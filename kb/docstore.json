If a loss is incurred it may be carried forward\nto future years provided the loss carry forward tests are satis\ufb01ed.\nAssessable income includes items such as salaries, wages, income\nfrom business, interest, rent and dividends.\nDeductions generally include expenses that have been incurred in the\ncourse of gaining or producing income, in addition to a number of\nspeci\ufb01c deductions allowable under legislation.\nDeductions are not allowed for personal expenses or those of a capital\nnature. However, if certain conditions are met, it is possible for\ncompanies and individuals to set off losses against other types of\nincome.\nTaxes on capital gains (Capital Gains Tax\n(CGT)\nCGT is imposed on gains realised from the sale of assets, with special\nrules applicable to the valuation of capital gains.\nFor taxation purposes, the assets subject to CGT are very broad and\ninclude both tangible and intangible assets.\nCertain assets such as motor vehicles, personal use assets and one\u2019s\nmain residence are subject to exemptions, while foreign residents are\nsubject to capital gains on only a limited range of assets, such as real\nproperty.\nCapital gains are included in taxpayers\u2019 assessable income and\ntherefore taxed at each taxpayer\u2019s applicable income tax rate (see\nbelow, Taxation of Individuals).\nIf the capital asset is held for longer than 12 months, Australian\nresidents are entitled 50% discount for taxation purposes. The CGT\nrules have recently been amended so that non-residents can no longer\naccess the 50% discount. Any capital loss incurred can be offset only\nagainst capital gains.\nThe aim of this guide is to provide a broad introduction to the\nframework of Australia\u2019s tax system.

Under these rules, the payer must withhold an\namount from certain payments it makes and then pay that amount to\nthe ATO, usually in regular instalments throughout the year, depending\non the size of the entity.\nWithholding taxes are often paid where dividends, interest or royalties\nare paid by an Australian resident to a foreign entity. The rate of\nwithholding is typically set out in the relevant double tax agreement.\nIn addition, withholding taxes also apply in relation to the failure to\nquote an Australian Business Number (ABN) or a Tax File Number (TFN)\nin various situations in which they are required (see below, Australian\nBusiness Numbers and Tax File Numbers).\nPay-as-you-go (PAYG)\nAustralia also has a \u2018pay-as-you-go\u2019 (PAYG) withholding tax regime.

If you earn income in the\ncountry, you must obtain a tax \u0000ile number (TFN) and pay taxes on your earnings.\nYour yearly tax liability is determined through the annual tax return process.\nFor employees, income tax is automatically deducted by employers during the\n\u0000inancial year, which spans from July 1 to June 30. Self-employed individuals are\nresponsible for making periodic income tax payments. At the end of each \u0000inancial\nyear, you must submit a tax return.\nYour tax return will calculate the precise tax amount owed for the year, accounting\nfor deductions, o\ufb00sets, and rebates. If the amount already paid is incorrect, you'll\neither owe additional taxes or be eligible for a tax refund.\nFor information on ways to lodge your tax return with H&R Block, see our Tax\nReturns page.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding Tax Returns in Australia\nAustralia employs a progressive tax system, meaning the more you earn, the higher\nyour tax liability. The Australian Taxation O\u0000ice (ATO) manages tax collection on\nbehalf of the government.\nYour income tax payment depends on your taxable income and encompasses all\nincome types, such as wages, business pro\u0000its, and investment returns, like interest\nearned from your bank account.Home /Insights & Advice /tax-return /Tax Returns in Australia", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1493, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96b68fc4-df9e-447f-b7ca-fbeea1506cb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "96b68fc4-df9e-447f-b7ca-fbeea1506cb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 126471, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b45886b0-c6af-4b7a-9114-60c5017e3fa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 126471, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "6600954733941c025f34c78f8629b3d255d5367c548ac866d134f800e99e915d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eeddcee7-d553-469e-9931-c6dcc47a76b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 126471, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "4ac29b554c97c4abf46fa6e4d32680dd07ad620bd728d193b8dcd0dc58cc886f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "52dc8316-6765-43eb-8950-d220c5088039", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc249d9e5ffb1197b362fae75617883f812996b35078a52a1310c243afb15873", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "356aee979d3996c10d329c706655d6e76949cf28349127817661cf888de97c42", "text": "26/12/2023, 01:31 Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia\nhttps://www.hrblock.com.au/tax-academy/tax-returns-australia 2/6This means that you need to declare various types of income when lodging your tax\nreturn.

You can claim tax deductions for investment-related expenses,\nbut there are rules and guidelines to follow. Capital gains are included in your tax\nreturn, and if held for more than 12 months, you're taxed on only half of the gain\n(capital gains tax discount).

The ATO o\ufb00ers the\nconvenience of downloading certain information directly into your tax return, such\nas Income Statements from your employer, details of taxable Centrelink payments,\nand private health insurance information. In addition to these, you'll also need to\ncollect additional information, which includes:Partnerships and partners: While the partnership possesses its own tax \u0000ile\nnumber (TFN), it doesn't directly pay income tax on its pro\u0000its. Each partner reports\ntheir respective share of the partnership income on their individual tax return.\nAdditionally, the partnership must submit a separate tax return under its TFN.\nTrusts and bene\u0000iciaries: Trusts lodge a return showing net income (total income\nminus deductions), while each bene\u0000iciary, whether a company or individual,\nlodges their own return. Bene\u0000iciaries report income received from the trust and\nany other assessable income.\nCompanies: Companies are separate legal entities and must submit a company tax\nreturn, along with paying taxes on the company's income. If you're a director, you'll\nstill be required to lodge your individual tax return.\nYour Tax File Number (TFN): \u00a0The ATO assigns a unique tax \u0000ile number to every\nperson who works or receives bene\u0000its in Australia and this number is valid for life.\nYou should never allow anyone else use your tax \u0000ile number for any reason, and\nyou should only ever supply your tax \u0000ile number to the Australian Taxation O\u0000ice,\nCentrelink, your bank, your employer (after you start a new job), your super fund\nand your registered tax agent.\nYour bank account details: You should have your bank account details ready\n(including the BSB and account number), in case you are eligible to receive a tax", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2513, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4bd15ff-2bcd-4b31-95a0-b5347a4ce3a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4bd15ff-2bcd-4b31-95a0-b5347a4ce3a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 126471, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5eaa322-24b7-4e7a-8a9d-6166e8cc0908", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 126471, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "11a3ac9d6f56f39336d13ca2c88a7e9d772234e3ef060d1625bd1b0e9e523b84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "52dc8316-6765-43eb-8950-d220c5088039", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 126471, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "cc249d9e5ffb1197b362fae75617883f812996b35078a52a1310c243afb15873", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "210d00fe-d571-4c88-9802-9b3d0694e874", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c3f665f20d6732c5b23dfa5f3a1a1b5780205be278102c1385b9b14bb3bca14", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9551eb5509aa3928668e1140155e008bda204c57b910d6018386d7d759026906", "text": "26/12/2023, 01:31 Tax Returns in Australia - H&R Block Australia\nhttps://www.hrblock.com.au/tax-academy/tax-returns-australia 4/6If you plan to claim more than $300 in work-related expenses you're also going to\nneed:\nOur tax return checklist has all the information and documents you may need to\ndetermine which information may be applicable for your tax return.\n\u00a0\nStep 2: Maximise your deductions\nTo maximise your tax deductions, consider both work-related and investment\nexpenses. When it comes to work-related expenses, ensure they directly relate to\nearning your income and maintain a record of expenses, such as receipts. This\nincludes technology costs, car and travel expenses, and expenses associated with\nworking from home. For investment-related expenses, claim costs incurred in\ngenerating interest, dividends, and account-keeping fees.

Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download What to do when you acquire an asset When you acquire a capital gains tax (CGT) asset, you should establish your acquisition date and share of ownership, and start keeping records. This will help you work out your capital gain or loss correctly, so you pay the correct amount of CGT when you dispose of the asset. Acquisition date Generally, the acquisition date is when you become the owner of the asset \u2013 for example, when you purchase it. However, there are 2\u00a0common situations where your acquisition date might differ from the date you become the owner: When you buy an asset under contract and do not take immediate possession. This commonly happens with real estate. In this case, your acquisition date is the date on the contract, not when you settle. When you inherit a CGT asset. In this case, the acquisition date is the date of death of the former owner. You should establish the date of acquisition because you will need it to work out your CGT when you dispose of the asset. It is important because: CGT does not apply if you owned the asset before CGT started on 20\u00a0September 1985 (but major improvements to a property since 20\u00a0September 1985 may be subject to CGT) the rules for working out a capital gain or loss have changed over time to qualify for the CGT discount you need to own the asset for at least 12\u00a0months. Joint ownership If you share ownership of an asset with others, each person makes a capital gain or loss. There are 2\u00a0types of shared ownership: tenants in common joint tenants. Tenants in common Tenants in common are 2\u00a0or more people who co-own an asset in defined shares. The shares may be unequal. When a CGT event occurs (such as selling the asset), the individuals split the capital gain or loss between them according to their share of ownership. Example: tenants in common Lui and Monica own a rental property as tenants in common. Lui has a 20% share and Monica has an 80% share. Lui and Monica decide to sell their rental property. They make a capital gain of $200,000. Lui and Monica split the capital gain according to their share of ownership: Lui has a capital gain of $40,000 (20%) Monica has a capital gain of $160,000 (80%). End of example Joint tenants Joint tenants have equal shares in the asset. Therefore, each person has an equal share of any capital gain or loss from a CGT event. When one joint tenant dies, their share in the asset is acquired in equal shares by the surviving joint tenants . Example: joint tenants Carmen and Joe own a rental property as joint tenants. They decide to sell their rental property. They make a capital gain of $68,000. Carmen and Joe each has a capital gain of $34,000 (50%). End of example Partnerships For CGT purposes, a partnership does not own an asset. Instead, each partner owns a proportion of the asset. When a CGT event occurs, the partners use their proportion to work out their capital gain or loss. Keeping records You must keep records of all transactions or events that are relevant to working out your capital gain or loss. What to record Your records must be in English or be translatable to English. Keep the following records: receipts of purchase or transfer details of interest on money you borrowed relating to the asset records of agent, accountant, legal and advertising costs receipts of insurance costs, rates and land taxes market valuations receipts of maintenance, repair and modification costs bank accounts showing brokerage fees on shares. You should also keep records to establish whether you have claimed an income tax deduction for an item of expenditure. If you have claimed a deduction, you cannot include the amount in the cost base of the asset. How long to keep records Keep records for 5\u00a0years after the year that the CGT event occurs.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4391, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c89b3330-52f4-46f9-97b6-0d09d1316631": {"__data__": {"id_": "c89b3330-52f4-46f9-97b6-0d09d1316631", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/acquiring-cgt-assets.md", "file_name": "acquiring-cgt-assets.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 8080, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f3ac5db1-35f7-40d1-94cd-36dac7dd7563", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/acquiring-cgt-assets.md", "file_name": "acquiring-cgt-assets.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 8080, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "36a49c4b78d59378113df94c3055862e3aa583a57fc0990d18e48fd024a44c1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc2b49b5-6a65-4d13-9e0c-98c631f807a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/acquiring-cgt-assets.md", "file_name": "acquiring-cgt-assets.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 8080, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "14e4bf41aceb7a30920e588eeec52760365cb7a36535c6712be3ed1baca90edb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae791c60-c928-49b9-a067-800d884fbdbf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "81ab42a0e2901c38c325ea0835cdc6e5e2bdec56b47f805b581fdca7b465e085", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0cb1a79473191a79b1913aaa9bbc34d8e23c4db4af69b9dbfd34428a98b2129b", "text": "When a CGT event occurs, the partners use their proportion to work out their capital gain or loss.

Example: keeping records for 5\u00a0years Liz sold some shares in September\u00a02022 and made a capital gain. This means the CGT event happened in the 2022\u201323 financial year. Liz needs to keep purchase and sale records of the shares until the end of the 2027\u201328 financial year (30\u00a0June\u00a02028). End of example Net capital loss If you have a net capital loss for the year, you should keep records of the loss. You can use the loss to offset a capital gain in a later year. There is no time limit on how long you can carry forward a net capital loss. Once you have offset the loss against a capital gain, you should keep records of the CGT event that resulted in the loss. Keep records for a further: 2\u00a0years for individuals and small and medium businesses 4\u00a0years for other taxpayers. Missing or destroyed records If you do not have records for your CGT assets, there are ways you can get the information you need. If you: bought a property , ask your solicitor or estate agent to give you copies of the records made improvements to an investment property , ask the builder for a copy of the receipt for payment bought shares in a company or units in a managed fund , ask your stockbroker or investment adviser to give you the relevant information received an asset as a gift , ask a professional valuer to tell you what the market value would have been lost your records in a natural disaster , we can help you reconstruct them . Establish the date you buy or acquire an asset, your share of ownership and records to keep.

Menu Search Building or renovating your home How to get the main residence exemption for your land while you build your future home. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download Eligibility for exemption before you move in If you build a dwelling on land you already own, the land normally is not exempt from capital gains tax (CGT) until the dwelling becomes your main residence. However, you can treat the land as your main residence for up to 4\u00a0years before you move in if you: have an ownership interest (other than a life interest) in the land build, repair or renovate a dwelling on the land, or finish a partly constructed dwelling move into the dwelling as soon as practicable after it is finished and continue to use it as your main residence for at least 3\u00a0months. The same option is available if you build a new dwelling to replace a dwelling that was demolished or destroyed. You can treat the vacant land as your main residence for up to 4\u00a0years while building your new home. How to apply the exemption If you choose to treat land as your main residence until your home is finished: the land is exempt from the time you acquire it or for up to 4\u00a0years before you move in, whichever is shorter if you or anyone else occupies a dwelling that is already on the land, the exemption period does not start until that dwelling is vacated you cannot treat any other dwelling as your main residence for the same period (except for a limited time if you are moving from one main residence to another ) you cannot choose to have a shorter period of exemption for the new dwelling in order to exempt your old home for part of the construction period. Example: treating land as main residence Ahmed built a new dwelling on a vacant block of land he bought, and moved from his old home into the new one. His key dates are: 3\u00a0November 1995 \u2013 bought old home 3\u00a0September 2008 \u2013 bought land for new dwelling 2\u00a0September 2022 \u2013 finished building new dwelling 1\u00a0October 2022 \u2013 sold old home 7\u00a0October 2022 \u2013 moved into new dwelling (this was as soon as practicable after completion). Ahmed can treat the new dwelling as his main residence from 7\u00a0October 2018. This is the 4\u00a0years immediately before the new dwelling actually becomes his main residence. If he chooses to do this, Ahmed's old home is exempt: from 3\u00a0November 1995 (when he acquired it) until 6\u00a0October 2018 (just before he began treating the dwelling under construction as his main residence) for the 6\u00a0months before he disposed of it \u2013 that is, from 1\u00a0April 2022 to 1\u00a0October 2022 \u2013 because during this period he can treat both dwellings as his main residence under the rules for moving from one main residence to another. End of example If the owner dies during construction The exemption can still apply if the owner of the dwelling under construction were to die at any time between: entering into contracts for the construction work the end of the first 3\u00a0months of residence in the new home. The surviving joint owner (or if none, the trustee of the deceased estate) can choose to treat the land and dwelling as the deceased's main residence. The conditions are the same, except that the exemption period ends when the deceased died. How to get the main residence exemption for your land while you build your future home.

Menu Search Calculating your CGT Use the calculator or steps to work out your CGT, including your capital proceeds and cost base. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download What you pay tax on If you sold assets during the year, such as property or shares, you need to work out your capital gain or loss for each asset. When you sell an asset for: more than it cost you \u2013 you have a capital gain less than it cost you \u2013 you have a capital loss. You pay tax on your net capital gains. This is: your total capital gains less any capital losses less any discount you are entitled to on your gains. There is a capital gains tax (CGT) discount of 50% for Australian individuals who own an asset for 12\u00a0months or more. This means you pay tax on only half the net capital gain on that asset. Some assets are exempt from CGT , such as your home. Example: CGT with discount Justin, an Australian resident, buys a block of land. He owns it for 18\u00a0months and sells it, making a profit of $10,000. He has no capital losses. Justin is entitled to the 50% CGT discount for the land. He will declare a capital gain of $5,000 in his tax return. End of example How to calculate your CGT Work out your CGT using our online calculator and record keeping tool. You can also access the tool and save your data through your myGov account External Link . CGT calculator and record keeping tool Calculate CGT yourself Step 1: Work out what you received for the asset This is your capital proceeds . It is what you receive when you sell the asset or another CGT event happens to it \u2013 for example, if the asset is destroyed and you receive an insurance payout. If you give an asset away or sell it to a friend for less than it is worth, your capital proceeds are the market value of the asset. Step 2: Work out your costs for the asset This is your cost base . It is what it cost you to acquire the asset, plus certain other costs you had to acquire, hold and dispose of the asset. If you made a loss on the asset, you work out the loss amount using the reduced cost base . If you made a gain on the asset and acquired it before 21\u00a0September\u00a01999 you can index the costs for inflation up to that date instead of using the CGT discount to reduce your capital gain. This may give you a lower net capital gain in some circumstances, such as if you also have capital losses. Step 3: Subtract the costs (2) from what you received (1). If the result is: more than zero, you have a capital gain for this asset less than zero, you have a capital loss for this asset (make sure you used the reduced cost base at step\u00a02). Step 4: Repeat steps 1\u20133 for each CGT event you have had this financial year for example, for each asset you have sold. Step 5: Subtract your capital losses from your capital gains If you have no allowable capital losses , skip to step\u00a07. If you have a net capital loss carried forward from previous years, subtract this first. You can choose which capital gains to subtract your losses from. If you have any capital gains that are not eligible for the CGT discount, subtract your losses from these gains first. This will give you the best result (the lowest CGT). Step 6: If the remaining amount is: more than zero \u2013 go to step\u00a07 less than zero \u2013 this is your net capital loss. Go to step\u00a08. Step 7: Apply the CGT discount (50% for individuals and trusts) to any remaining capital gains that are eligible Generally, a capital gain is eligible for the discount if you are an Australian resident and you owned the asset for at least 12\u00a0months. If you owned an asset less than 12\u00a0months you cannot discount a capital gain on that asset. For complying super funds the discount is 33.33%.

Step 8: Report your net capital gain or loss in your income tax return If you have a net capital gain you pay tax on the gain at your marginal income tax rate.

Example: working out CGT for a single asset Rhi buys an investment property for $500,000 and sells it 5\u00a0years later for $600,000. She has no other capital gains or losses. Using the steps above , Rhi works out her capital gain as follows. The capital proceeds from the CGT event are $600,000. The cost base is $530,000, made up of: purchase costs of $500,000 + $15,000 stamp duty + $1,200 conveyancing fees sale costs of $1,300 conveyancing fees + $12,500 agent's commission. Rhi\u2019s capital gain on the investment property is: $600,000\u00a0\u2212\u00a0$530,000\u00a0=\u00a0$70,000 Rhi has no other capital gains or losses, so she skips to step\u00a07. This step is not applicable. This step is not applicable. Rhi can use the CGT discount to reduce her capital gain because she is an Australian resident and owned the asset for at least 12\u00a0months: $70,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050%\u00a0= $35,000 Rhi reports a net capital gain of $35,000 and a capital gain of $70,000 at labels A and H respectively in item 18 in her supplementary income tax return. She will pay tax on this gain at her marginal income tax rate. The capital gain for the property happens on the date of the sale contract, not the date of settlement. For example, if contracts are exchanged on 4\u00a0June 2023 and settlement happens on 6\u00a0July 2023, Rhi must report her capital gain in her income tax return for the financial year ending 30\u00a0June 2023. End of example Example: working out CGT for multiple assets Take the same facts as above, except that in addition to the investment property, Rhi also sells some shares in the same financial year. Rhi bought 1,000 shares at $10 each for a total of $10,000, including stamp duty and brokerage costs. Rhi sells the shares (at a loss) for $5,500. There are no brokerage costs on the sale of the shares. Using the steps above, Rhi works out her net capital gain or loss as follows. The capital proceeds from the sale of the shares are $5,500. The reduced cost base is $10,000. This includes stamp duty and brokerage, which are costs Rhi had to acquire the asset. Rhi\u2019s capital loss on the shares is: $5,500 \u2212 $10,000\u00a0=\u00a0($4,500) Rhi also had a capital gain of $70,000 on her investment property (see previous example). $70,000 (gains) \u2212 $4,500 (losses) = $65,500 Rhi has a capital gain so she continues to step 7.", "start_char_idx": 3369, "end_char_idx": 6994, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a30746d3-7847-4696-8934-6dc099b2e32e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a30746d3-7847-4696-8934-6dc099b2e32e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/calculating-your-cgt.md", "file_name": "calculating-your-cgt.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 10112, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ec1bb00-a2a3-43fb-bbd8-71135d573137", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/calculating-your-cgt.md", "file_name": "calculating-your-cgt.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 10112, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "fad40bffec5a7466db897023601223fe499872139d9f81794d024c42bc3783d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aadb21b4-225b-487b-b359-24d3b4c0a349", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/calculating-your-cgt.md", "file_name": "calculating-your-cgt.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 10112, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "f6dad7047aefb2720a6162f49a6850177d78ef22ad14f9979e41c01aad42052d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "93d95428-d48f-4e2e-ae5b-0bdc751b7826", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1a279e6a89395cefa92dd91875d080905a3c8176819c9678b190a5b23d4152f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9770937d7ce945cba14cea98d5098d5dbd7b8775f1a0f083f8f7517a82e1f67d", "text": "Rhi sells the shares (at a loss) for $5,500.

Menu Search CGT discount Find out if your asset is eligible for the 50% CGT discount. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download How the CGT discount works When you sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, you can reduce your capital gain by 50%, if both of the following apply: you owned the asset for at least 12\u00a0months you are an Australian resident for tax purposes. This is called the capital gains tax (CGT) discount. 12-month ownership requirement For an asset to qualify for the CGT discount you must own it for at least 12\u00a0months before the 'CGT event' happens. The CGT event is the point at which you make a capital gain or loss. You exclude the day of acquisition and the day of the CGT event when working out if you owned the CGT asset for at least 12\u00a0months before the 'CGT event\u2019 happens. If you sell the asset and there is no contract of sale , the CGT event happens at the time of sale. If there is a contract to sell the asset , the CGT event happens on the date of the contract, not when you settle. Property sales usually work this way. If the asset is lost or destroyed , the CGT event happens when: you first receive an insurance payment or other compensation if there is no insurance payment or compensation, when the loss occurred or was discovered. You can count an asset\u2019s previous ownership towards your 12-month ownership period if you acquired it: through a deceased estate if the asset was acquired by the deceased on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 through a relationship breakdown \u2013 you will satisfy the 12-month requirement if the combined period your spouse and you owned the asset was more than 12\u00a0months as a rollover replacement for an asset that was lost, destroyed or compulsorily acquired if the period of ownership of the original asset and the replacement asset was at least 12\u00a0months. Exclusions from the CGT discount You cannot use the CGT discount in the following circumstances. Home first used for rental or business in last 12 months If the asset is your home and you first started using it for rental or business less than 12\u00a0months before disposing of it, you can't use the CGT discount. You use the indexation method instead If you have owned the asset since before 21\u00a0September 1999, you can index the cost of the asset for inflation instead of using the CGT discount. But in most cases you will get a better result (a smaller capital gain) by using the discount. Foreign or temporary residents The full CGT discount cannot be used for capital gains made by foreign or temporary residents after 8\u00a0May 2012. Creation of new asset The CGT discount is not available for a CGT event that creates a new asset and a capital gain. This might happen, for example, with a restrictive covenant, where you receive payment for agreeing not to do something or granting a lease. In these cases the asset has not been acquired at least 12\u00a0months before the CGT event. Disposal of interest in a non-widely held entity The CGT discount may be denied when you dispose of certain shares or trust interests in non-widely held companies and trusts. These are companies and trusts with fewer than 300\u00a0members. Conversion of income asset If an income asset is converted into a capital asset for the purposes of claiming the CGT discount, the discount may be denied (under Part\u00a0IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ). Trusts and companies If an asset is owned for at least 12\u00a0months: Australian trusts can discount a capital gain by 50% complying super funds can discount a capital gain by 33.33%.

Menu Search CGT events How and when CGT is triggered, such as when an asset is sold, lost or destroyed. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download What is a CGT event? When you dispose of an asset that is subject to capital gains tax (CGT), it is called a CGT event. This is the point at which you make a capital gain or loss. Common disposals that will trigger a CGT event include: selling an asset trading, exchanging or swapping assets loss or destruction of an asset or creating contractual or other rights (this is known as an involuntary disposal). The type of CGT event that applies to your situation may affect: the time when the CGT event happens how to calculate your capital gain or loss. Watch: CGT events Media: CGT Events https://tv.ato.gov.au/ato-tv/media?v=bi9or7odtmhqdk External Link ( Duration: 01:50) Sale or disposal of asset Selling or disposing of an asset will trigger a CGT event and you may have a capital gain or capital loss. If there is a contract of sale, the CGT event happens when you enter into the contract. For example, if you sell a house, the CGT event happens on the date of the contract, not when you settle. If there is no contract of sale, the CGT event is usually when you stop being the asset's owner. For example, if you sell shares, the CGT event happens on the date of sale. Example: contract of sale In June 2022, Sue entered into a contract to sell land she owned. The contract settled in October 2022. Sue made the capital gain in the 2021\u201322 income year (the year she entered into the contract), not the 2022\u201323 income year (the year settlement took place). End of example Your capital gain or loss for an asset is usually the selling price less the original cost and certain other costs associated with acquiring, holding and disposing of the asset. Find out how to calculate your CGT . Loss, theft or destruction of asset If your CGT asset is lost, stolen or destroyed: the CGT event happens when you first receive compensation for the loss, theft or destruction your capital gain is the amount of compensation less the asset\u2019s original cost. If you do not receive any compensation, the CGT event happens when the loss is discovered or the destruction occurred. If you replace the asset with a similar asset, you may be able to defer (or 'roll over') your capital gain until another CGT event happens, such as selling the replacement asset. See Involuntary disposal of a CGT asset for more information. Example: insurance policy Laurie's rental property was destroyed by fire in June 2022. He received compensation under an insurance policy in October 2022. The CGT event happened in October 2022 when he received the compensation. End of example Example: no compensation or insurance policy Christine owned a rental property that was damaged by floods in May 2022. The local council deemed the property uninhabitable in August 2022. The property was demolished in November 2022 and Christine did not receive any compensation. The CGT event happened in May 2022 when the damage happened. End of example All CGT events All CGT events are listed below. If more than one CGT event happens, you apply the rules for the one that best matches your situation.

Menu Search Compulsory acquisition of your home Find out if the payment you receive for compulsory acquisition of your home is exempt from CGT. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download How CGT applies when your home is compulsorily acquired If all or part of your home is compulsorily acquired, you can apply the main residence exemption to any money or other compensation you receive. If your home is compulsorily acquired and you are entitled to the full main residence exemption , you ignore any capital gain or loss. You are also covered by the main residence exemption if only part of your property is compulsorily acquired, such as: land adjacent to your home a structure associated with your home, such as a garage. You can apply the main residence exemption to a maximum of 2\u00a0hectares of your property during your ownership. To be exempt the land must be used for private purposes. If the land you use for private purposes is larger than 2\u00a0hectares, you can nominate which part the exemption will apply to. However the 2-hectare total must always include the land underneath your dwelling. This limit may be reached in stages through multiple capital gains tax (CGT) events . You also ignore a capital gain or loss from the compulsory acquisition of land adjacent to an inherited dwelling. Example: compulsory acquisition and main residence exemption Rene and Vidia live in a house on a 10-hectare block. It is their main residence. The land underneath the house is 0.03\u00a0hectares of the block. The Department of Roads compulsorily acquired a 1.2\u00a0hectare strip of their land. Rene and Vidia chose to treat the 1.2\u00a0hectare strip as part of their main residence. The money they received from the acquisition was therefore exempt from CGT. A few years later, Rene and Vidia had a second compulsory acquisition. The Water Company purchased one hectare of their remaining land. This time the couple could not claim a full exemption from CGT. Their home still qualified as their main residence, but the main residence exemption is limited to 2\u00a0hectares during their ownership. As they had previously used the exemption for 1.2\u00a0hectares, and their house occupies 0.03\u00a0hectares, the maximum they can claim for the second acquisition is: 2\u00a0hectares \u2212 1.2\u00a0hectares \u2212 0.03\u00a0hectares = 0.77\u00a0hectares Since 0.77\u00a0hectares is 77% of the one hectare that was compulsorily acquired, Rene and Vidia could only treat this percentage of the proceeds as exempt from CGT. End of example What is compulsory acquisition? Compulsory acquisition is when a government agency takes possession of all or part of your property. It may also be done by an entity acting on behalf of government. Records you need to keep You must keep records when you claim the main residence exemption from CGT.

Menu Search Destruction of your home Check if your insurance payment or land is exempt from CGT. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download If your home is destroyed accidentally (such as through a natural disaster), you can apply the main residence exemption to any money you receive as a result. This means if your home was fully exempt before it was destroyed, then: if you sell your vacant land, it is exempt from capital gains tax (CGT) any insurance payment or other compensation is exempt from CGT. If your home was only partially exempt before it was destroyed, CGT will apply to the part that was not exempt. For example, CGT will apply if: you used part of your home for rental or business your home was on more than 2\u00a0hectares of land . If you move to a new home before you sell the vacant land of your former home, you can treat both as your main residence for up to 6\u00a0months. If you build a new home on your land, you can treat the land as your main residence for up to 4\u00a0years before you move in. During this period you cannot claim the main residence exemption for any other dwelling. We can help you deal with a disaster \u2013 for example, by helping you reconstruct your tax records or allowing early access to refunds. Check if your insurance payment or land is exempt from CGT.

Last updated 9 July 2023 Print or Download General background information about CGT, whether and how it applies to you. What is capital gains tax and what rate of tax do you pay? CGT is the tax that you pay on any capital gain you include in your annual income tax return. It is not a separate tax, merely a component of your income tax. You are taxed on your net capital gain at your marginal tax rate. Your net capital gain is: your total capital gains for 2022\u201323, minus your total capital losses for the year and any unapplied net capital losses from earlier income years, minus any CGT discount and small business CGT concessions to which you are entitled. If your total capital losses for 2022\u201323 are more than your total capital gains, the difference is your net capital loss for the year. You can carry it forward to later income years to be deducted from future capital gains. You cannot deduct capital losses or a net capital loss from your other assessable income. There is no time limit on how long you can carry forward a net capital loss. You apply your net capital losses in the order that you make them. There are special rules for capital losses made on collectables . You cannot make a capital loss on a personal use asset . If you are completing a tax return for an individual and want more information on how to apply your capital losses, see in Part\u00a0B steps\u00a05 and 6. For more information for companies, trusts and funds or for completing the CGT summary workshee t, see Part\u00a0C step\u00a02 . Capital gain or capital loss You make a capital gain or capital loss if a CGT event happens. You can also make a capital gain if a managed fund or other trust distributes a capital gain to you. For most CGT events your capital gain is the difference between your capital proceeds and the cost base of your CGT asset. For example, if you sell an asset for more than you paid for it, the difference is your capital gain. You make a capital loss if your reduced cost base of your CGT asset is greater than the capital proceeds. Generally, you can disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make on an asset if you acquired it before 20\u00a0September 1985 (pre-CGT). For more information, see Exemptions and rollovers . There are special rules that apply when working out gains and losses from depreciating assets. A depreciating asset is a tangible asset (other than land or trading stock) that has a limited effective life. It can be expected to decline in value over the time it is used. Certain intangible assets are also depreciating assets. If you use a depreciating asset for a taxable purpose (such as in a business) any gain you make on it is treated as ordinary income and any loss as a deduction. It is only when a depreciating asset is used for a non-taxable purpose (used privately) that you can make a capital gain or capital loss on it. For more information, see CGT and depreciating assets . To work out whether you have to pay tax on your capital gains, you need to know: whether a CGT event has happened the time of the CGT event what assets are subject to CGT how to calculate the capital gain or capital loss how to determine your capital proceeds, cost base and reduced cost base how to apply capital losses and the methods available to calculate a capital gain whether there is any exemption or rollover that allows you to reduce or disregard the capital gain or capital loss whether the CGT discount applies whether you are entitled to any of the small business CGT concessions. What is a CGT event? CGT events are the different types of transactions or events that may result in a capital gain or capital loss. Many CGT events involve a CGT asset; some relate directly to capital receipts (capital proceeds).

What is a CGT event? CGT events are the different types of transactions or events that may result in a capital gain or capital loss. Many CGT events involve a CGT asset; some relate directly to capital receipts (capital proceeds). You need to know which type of CGT event applies in your situation. It affects how you calculate your capital gain or capital loss and when you include it in your net capital gain or net capital loss. The range of CGT events is wide. Some happen often and affect many people while others are rare and affect only a few people. There is a summary of the various types of CGT events at Appendix\u00a01 . The most common CGT event happens if you dispose of a CGT asset to someone else, (such as if you sell it or give it away, including to a relative). A CGT event also happens when: an asset you own is lost or destroyed (the destruction may be voluntary or involuntary) shares you own are cancelled, surrendered or redeemed you enter into an agreement not to work in a particular industry for a set period of time a trustee makes a non-assessable payment to you from a managed fund or other unit trusts (including a CCIV sub-fund trust) you have an annual cost base reduction that exceeds the cost base of your interest in an attribution managed investment trust or attribution CCIV sub-fund trust a company makes a payment (not a dividend) to you as a shareholder a liquidator or administrator declares that shares or financial instruments you own are worthless you receive an amount from a local council for disruption to your business assets by roadworks you stop being an Australian resident you enter into a conservation covenant you dispose of a depreciating asset that you used for private purposes. Subdividing land does not result in a CGT event if you retain ownership of the subdivided blocks. Therefore, you do not make a capital gain or a capital loss at the time of the subdivision. Australian residents make a capital gain or capital loss if a CGT event happens to any of their assets anywhere in the world. As a general rule, foreign residents make a capital gain or capital loss only if a CGT event happens to a CGT asset that is taxable Australian property . Order in which CGT events apply If more than one CGT event can happen, use the one that is most specific to your situation. Time of the CGT event The timing of a CGT event is important because it determines in which income year you report your capital gain or capital loss. If you dispose of a CGT asset to someone else, the CGT event happens when you enter into the contract for disposal. If there is no contract, the CGT event generally happens when you stop being the asset\u2019s owner. Example 1: Contract In June 2023, Sue enters into a contract to sell land. The contract settles in October 2023. Sue makes the capital gain in 2022\u201323 (the income year in which she enters into the contract), not 2023\u201324 (the income year in which settlement takes place). End of example If a CGT asset you own is lost or destroyed, the CGT event happens when you first receive compensation for the loss or destruction. If you do not receive any compensation, the CGT event happens when the loss is discovered or the destruction occurred.

Many CGT assets are easily recognisable, for example, land, shares in a company, and units in a unit trust. Other CGT assets are not so well understood such as contractual rights, options, foreign currency, crypto assets and goodwill. All assets are subject to the CGT rules unless they are specifically excluded. One example of a crypto asset is bitcoin. For more information on the tax treatment of crypto assets, see Crypto asset investments . CGT assets fall into one of 3 categories: collectables personal use assets other assets Collectables Collectables include the following items that you use or keep mainly for the personal use or enjoyment of yourself or your associates: paintings, sculptures, drawings, engravings or photographs, reproductions of these items or property of a similar description or use jewellery antiques coins or medallions rare folios, manuscripts or books postage stamps or first day covers. A collectable is also: an interest in any of the items listed above a debt that arises from any of those items an option or right to acquire any of those items. You can only use capital losses from collectables to reduce capital gains (including future capital gains) from collectables. You disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make from a collectable if any of the following apply: you acquired the collectable for $500 or less you acquired an interest in the collectable for $500 or less before 16\u00a0December 1995 you acquired an interest in the collectable when it had a market value of $500 or less. If you dispose of a number of collectables individually that you would usually dispose of as a set, you are exempt from paying CGT only if you acquired the set for $500 or less. This does not apply to an individual collectable you acquired before 16\u00a0December 1995, which is exempt from CGT if you acquired it for less than $500. This is irrespective of whether or not it would usually be disposed of as part of a set. Personal use assets A personal use asset is: a CGT asset, other than a collectable, that you use or keep mainly for the personal use or enjoyment of yourself or your associates an option or a right to acquire a personal use asset a debt resulting from a CGT event involving a CGT asset kept mainly for your personal use or enjoyment a debt resulting from you doing something other than gaining or producing your assessable income or carrying on a business. Personal use assets may include such items as: boats furniture electrical goods household items crypto assets (if they are acquired and used in a short period of time mainly to purchase items for personal use or consumption). Land and buildings are not personal use assets. Any capital loss you make from a personal use asset is disregarded. If a CGT event happened to a personal use asset, disregard any capital gain you make if you acquired the asset for $10,000 or less. If you disposed of personal use assets individually that would usually be sold as a set, you get the exemption only if you acquired the set for $10,000 or less. Other assets Assets that are not collectables or personal use assets include: land shares in a company rights and options leases units in a unit trust crypto assets (if they are acquired and held for some time before being used, or only a small proportion is used to buy items for personal use or consumption) goodwill licences convertible notes your home (see Exemptions ) contractual rights foreign currency any major capital improvement made to certain land or pre-CGT assets.

Partnerships It is the individual partners who make a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event, not the partnership itself. For CGT purposes, each partner owns a proportion of each CGT asset. Each partner calculates a capital gain or capital loss on their share of each asset and claims their share of a credit for foreign resident capital gains withholding amounts. Tenants in common Individuals who own an asset as tenants in common may hold unequal interests in the asset. Each tenant in common makes a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event in line with their interest in the asset. For example, a couple could own a rental property as tenants in common with one having a 20% interest and the other having an 80% interest. The capital gain or capital loss made when the rental property they dispose of (or another CGT event happens) is split between the individuals according to their legal interest in the property. Joint tenants For CGT purposes, individuals who own an asset as joint tenants are each treated as if they own an equal interest in the asset as a tenant in common . Each joint tenant makes a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event in line with their interest in the asset. For example, a couple owning a rental property as joint tenants split the capital gain or capital loss equally between them. When a joint tenant dies, their interest in the asset is taken to have been acquired in equal shares by the surviving joint tenants on the date of death. Separate assets For CGT purposes, there are exceptions to the rule that what is attached to the land is part of the land. In some circumstances, a building or structure is considered to be a CGT asset separate from the land. Improvements to an asset (including land) acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 may also be treated as a separate CGT asset. This includes if you acquire land on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 which is adjacent to land you already own (purchased before 20\u00a0September 1985) and you amalgamate both pieces of land on one title. Example 3: Adjacent land On 1\u00a0April 1984 Dani bought a block of land. On 1\u00a0June 2023, she bought an adjacent block. Dani amalgamated the titles to the 2\u00a0blocks into one title. The second block is treated as a separate CGT asset distinct from the first block. Since the second block was acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 it is subject to CGT provisions. Therefore, Dani can make a capital gain or loss from the second block when the whole area of land is sold. End of example Buildings, structures and other capital improvements to land you acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 A building, structure or other capital improvement on land that you acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 is a separate CGT asset, not part of the land, if a balancing adjustment provision applies to it. For example, a timber mill building is subject to a balancing adjustment if it is sold or destroyed, so it is treated as an asset separate from the land it is on. Buildings and structures on land acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 A building or structure on land that you acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 is a separate asset if: you entered into a contract for the construction of the building or structure on or after that date, or there was no contract for its construction, and construction began on or after that date. Other capital improvements to pre-CGT assets If you make a capital improvement to a CGT asset you acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985, this improvement is treated as a separate asset. It is subject to CGT if, at the time a CGT event happens to the original asset, the cost base of the capital improvement is: more than the improvement threshold for the year in which the event happens (see table\u00a01 ) more than 5% of the amount of money and property you receive from the event.", "start_char_idx": 10643, "end_char_idx": 14942, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25a70a17-9539-46d7-b6d5-76d8c83613f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "25a70a17-9539-46d7-b6d5-76d8c83613f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/does-capital-gains-tax-apply-to-you?anchor=Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you#Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you.md", "file_name": "does-capital-gains-tax-apply-to-you?anchor=Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you#Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 79077, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9b2c256-d28b-4eb0-8cfa-9e376f05d483", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/does-capital-gains-tax-apply-to-you?anchor=Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you#Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you.md", "file_name": "does-capital-gains-tax-apply-to-you?anchor=Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you#Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 79077, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "2b5e5d34a15936ccab9d810a6da7ab09a983d6d2e0c2438702213f2759641f17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1360fe8c-43e2-40e2-85fe-848e3aaa3d1e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/does-capital-gains-tax-apply-to-you?anchor=Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you#Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you.md", "file_name": "does-capital-gains-tax-apply-to-you?anchor=Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you#Does_capital_gains_tax_apply_to_you.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 79077, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "7117fdc3ec805787553d2422ad2300c90e33314d8a91d328efeffce3c86b8093", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f301f51-c92e-477c-b187-7f52db33b1b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a37a6afcb472ed7cacd9fe6265470dc67a1f01312f982aeb1789673aba1a3e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "050e34e998debd5f597d9facde06b1c034bc53691303049833d194b6d45e79d1", "text": "Buildings and structures on land acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 A building or structure on land that you acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 is a separate asset if: you entered into a contract for the construction of the building or structure on or after that date, or there was no contract for its construction, and construction began on or after that date.

Whatever you receive as a result of a CGT event are your \u2018capital proceeds\u2019. For most CGT events, your capital proceeds are an amount of money or the value of any property you: receive, or are entitled to receive. If you receive (or are entitled to receive) foreign currency, you work out the capital proceeds by converting it to Australian currency at the time of the relevant CGT event. If you receive property (including shares) subject to a deed of escrow (which imposes a restriction on dealing in that property), you include the market value of the property at the time of the relevant CGT event in your capital proceeds. You reduce your capital proceeds from a CGT event if: you are not likely to receive some or all of the proceeds the non-receipt of some or all of the proceeds is not due to anything you have done or failed to do you took all reasonable steps to get payment.

Market value substitution rule In some cases, if you receive nothing in exchange for a CGT asset (for example, if you give it away as a gift), you are taken to have received the market value of the asset at the time of the CGT event. You may also be taken to have received the market value if: your capital proceeds are more or less than the market value of the CGT asset, and you and the purchaser were not dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length in connection with the event. This is known as the market value substitution rule for capital proceeds. You are said to be dealing at arm\u2019s length with someone if each party acts independently and neither party exercises influence or control over the other in connection with the transaction. The law looks not only at the relationship between the parties but also at the quality of the bargaining between them. Example 4: Gifting an asset On 7\u00a0May 2007, Martha and Stephen bought a block of land. In November 2022, they complete a transfer form to have the block transferred to their adult son, Paul, as a gift. Because they received nothing for it, Martha and Stephen are taken to have received the market value of the land at the time it was transferred to Paul. End of example The market value substitution rule for capital proceeds is subject to some exceptions. For example, the substitution rule for capital proceeds does not apply to the following examples of CGT event C2 (about cancellation, surrender and similar endings): the expiry of a CGT asset that the taxpayer owns the cancellation of a statutory licence held by the taxpayer. It also does not apply where CGT event C2 happens for interests held in companies and unit trusts that: have at least 300\u00a0members or unit holders do not have concentrated ownership. It also does not apply if you are a complying superannuation fund, a complying approved deposit fund or a pooled superannuation trust if both of the following apply: the capital proceeds from the CGT event exceed the market value of the CGT asset assuming the capital proceeds were your statutory income, the proceeds would be non-arm\u2019s length income There are special rules for calculating the proceeds from a depreciating asset. If the taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA) rules apply to you, there are special rules for calculating proceeds from a CGT asset, where you start or cease to have a financial arrangement as consideration for providing that CGT asset. For more information, see: Transferring property to family or friends CGT and depreciating assets What is the cost base? The cost base of a CGT asset is generally the cost of the asset when you bought it. It also includes certain other costs associated with acquiring, holding and disposing of the asset. For most CGT events, you need the cost base of the CGT asset to work out whether you have made a capital gain. If you may have made a capital loss, you need the reduced cost base of the CGT asset for your calculation. The columns labelled \u2018Capital gain\u2019 and \u2018Capital loss\u2019 in the tables at Appendix\u00a01 indicate whether the cost base and reduced cost base of an asset are relevant for a CGT event. If they are not relevant, the same columns in the tables explain how to work out your capital gain or loss. For example, if you enter into an agreement not to work in a particular industry for a set period of time, CGT event D1 specifies that you calculate your capital gain or capital loss by comparing the capital proceeds with the incidental costs.

For more information, see: CGT and depreciating assets Guide to depreciating assets 2023 Elements of the cost base The cost base of a CGT asset is made up of 5 elements: money or property given for the asset incidental costs of acquiring the CGT asset or that relate to the CGT event costs of owning the asset capital costs to increase or preserve the value of your asset or to install or move it capital costs of preserving or defending your ownership of or rights to your asset. You need to work out the amount for each element, then add them together to work out the cost base of your CGT asset. If there is an amount paid in a foreign currency that is part of the cost base you should convert it to Australian currency at the time of the relevant transaction or event. If you are registered for GST, reduce each element of the cost base of your asset by any related GST net input tax credits. If you are not registered for GST, you do not make any adjustments as the GST is included in the cost base. First element: money or property given for the asset Include in the first element: the money paid (or required to be paid) for the asset the market value of property given (or required to be given) to acquire the asset. Second element: incidental costs of acquiring the CGT asset or that relate to the CGT event There are 10 incidental costs you may have incurred in acquiring the asset or for the CGT event that happens to it, including its disposal. They are: remuneration for the services of a surveyor, valuer, auctioneer, accountant, broker, agent, consultant or legal adviser (you can include the cost of advice concerning the operation of the tax law as an incidental cost only if the advice was provided by a recognised tax adviser and you incurred the cost after 30\u00a0June 1989) costs of transfer stamp duty or other similar duty costs of advertising or marketing (but not entertainment) to find a seller or buyer costs relating to the making of any valuation or apportionment to determine your capital gain or capital loss search fees relating to an asset (such as fees to check land titles and similar fees, but not travel costs to find an asset suitable for purchase) the cost of a conveyancing kit (or a similar cost) borrowing expenses (such as loan application fees and mortgage discharge fees) expenditure that is incurred by the head company of a consolidated group to an entity that is not a member of the group reasonably relates to a CGT asset held by the head company, and is incurred because of a transaction that is between members of the group expenditure that is incurred as a direct result of your ownership of a CGT asset ending (also known as termination, exit or similar fees). You do not include costs if you: have claimed a tax deduction for them in any year, or omitted to claim a deduction but can still claim it because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired. Third element: costs of owning the asset The costs of owning an asset include rates, land taxes, repairs and insurance premiums. Non-deductible interest on borrowings to finance a loan used to acquire a CGT asset and on loans used to finance capital expenditure you incur to increase an asset\u2019s value are also third element costs.

You cannot include them at all in the cost base of collectables or personal use assets. You cannot index these costs or use them to work out a capital loss. For more information, see Indexation of the cost base . Fourth element: capital costs to increase or preserve the value of your asset or to install or move it The 4th element is capital costs you incurred for the purpose or the expected effect of increasing or preserving the asset\u2019s value. For example, costs incurred in applying (successfully or unsuccessfully) for zoning changes. It also includes capital costs you incurred that relate to installing or moving an asset. But, it does not include capital expenditure incurred for goodwill, which may be deductible as a business-related cost. For more information, see Guide to depreciating assets 2023 . Fifth element: capital costs of preserving or defending your ownership of or rights to your asset Capital expenses you incur to preserve or defend your ownership of, or rights to, the asset come under this element, for example, you paid a call on shares. Other adjustments to the cost base Assets acquired after 13\u00a0May 1997 If you acquired a CGT asset after 13\u00a0May 1997, the cost base of the asset excludes any expenditure in the first, 4th or 5th element for which you have claimed a tax deduction in any income year, or have omitted to claim but can still claim as a deduction because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired heritage conservation expenditure and Landcare and water facilities expenditure incurred after 12\u00a0November 1998 that give rise to a tax offset. Special rules apply for land and buildings. For more information, see Cost base adjustments for capital works deductions . Reversal of deduction: effect on cost base In some cases, a deduction you have claimed on a CGT asset can be partly or wholly \u2018reversed\u2019. This means that part or all of the deduction may be included in your assessable income in the income year the CGT event happens. In this case, you increase the cost base of the CGT asset by the amount you have to include in your assessable income. Indexation of the cost base If a CGT event happened to a CGT asset you acquired at or before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999, you can use either the indexation method or the discount method to calculate your capital gain. If you use the indexation method, some of the cost base expenditure you incurred up to this time may be indexed to account for inflation up to the September 1999 quarter. Only expenditure incurred before this time may be indexed because changes to the law mean indexation was frozen at that date. For more information, see How to work out your capital gain or capital loss . What is the reduced cost base? When a CGT event happens to a CGT asset and you haven\u2019t made a capital gain, you need the asset\u2019s reduced cost base to work out whether you have made a capital loss. Remember, you can use a capital loss to reduce capital gains only, you cannot use it to reduce other income.

Elements of the reduced cost base The reduced cost base of a CGT asset has the same 5 elements as the cost base , except for the third element: money or property given for the asset incidental costs of acquiring the CGT asset or that relate to the CGT event balancing adjustment amount (any amount that is assessable because of a balancing adjustment for the asset or that would be assessable if certain balancing adjustment relief were not available) capital costs to increase or preserve the value of your asset or to install or move it capital costs of preserving or defending your title or rights to your asset. These elements are not indexed. You need to work out the amount for each element, then add the amounts together to find out your reduced cost base for the relevant CGT asset. If you are registered for GST, you reduce each element of the reduced cost base of the asset by the amount of any GST net input tax credits for that element. If you are not registered for GST you do not make any adjustment and the GST paid is included in the reduced cost base. The reduced cost base does not include any costs you: have incurred for which you have claimed a tax deduction, or have omitted to claim, but can still claim, a deduction because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired. For example, capital works deductions for capital expenditure. Example 5: Capital works deduction: effect on reduced cost base Danuta acquired a new income-producing asset on 28\u00a0September 2005 for $100,000. She sold it for $90,000 in November 2022. During the period she owned it, she claimed capital works deductions of $7,500. Her capital loss is worked out as follows: Cost base $100,000 less capital works deductions $7,500 Reduced cost base $92,500 less capital proceeds $90,000 Capital loss $2,500 End of example Modifications to the cost base and reduced cost base In some cases, the general rules for calculating the cost base and reduced cost base have to be modified. For example, you substitute the market value for the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base if: you did not incur expenditure to acquire the asset some or all of the expenditure you incurred cannot be valued you did not deal at arm\u2019s length with the previous owner in acquiring the asset. This is known as the market value substitution rule for cost base and reduced cost base. There are exceptions to the market value substitution rule. One exception is where shares in a company, or units in a unit trust, are issued or allotted to you but you did not pay anything for them. You do not include expenditure you subsequently recoup (such as an insurance payout you receive or an amount paid for by someone else) in the cost base and reduced cost of a CGT asset except to the extent the recouped amount is included in your assessable income. Example 6: Recouped expenditure John bought a building in 2000 for $200,000 and incurred $10,000 in legal costs associated with the purchase. As part of a settlement, the vendor agreed to pay $4,000 of the legal costs. John did not claim as a tax deduction any part of the $6,000 he paid in legal costs. He later sells the building. As he received reimbursement of $4,000 of the legal costs, in working out his capital gain, he includes only the $6,000 he incurred in the cost base. End of example If you acquire a CGT asset and only part of the expenditure relates to the acquisition of the CGT asset, you can only include that part of the expenditure that is reasonably attributable to the acquisition of the asset in its cost base and reduced cost base. Apportionment is also required if you incur expenditure and only part of that expenditure relates to another element of the cost base and reduced cost base. Similarly, if a CGT event happens only to part of your CGT asset, you generally apportion the asset\u2019s cost base and reduced cost base to work out the capital gain or capital loss from the CGT event.

General value shifting regime Value shifting generally occurs when a dealing or transaction between 2 parties is not at market value. It results in the value of one asset decreasing and (usually) the value of another asset increasing. The general value shifting regime (GVSR) rules apply to value shifts that arise: because interests in a company or trust are issued or bought back at other than market value, or because their rights are varied so that the value of some interests increases while the value of others decreases (direct value shifts on interests) because 2 entities under the same control or ownership conduct dealings or transactions that are neither at market value nor arm\u2019s length, so that the value of interests in one entity decreases while (usually) the value of interests in the other entity increases (indirect value shifting) from the creation of a right over a non-depreciating asset in favour of an associate for less than market value (direct value shifts by creating rights). The rules on direct value shifts on interests target only equity or loan interests held by an individual or entity that controls the company or trust, the controller\u2019s associates and, if the company or trust is closely held, any active participants in the arrangement. The indirect value shifting rules target only equity or loan interests held by an individual or entity that controls the 2 entities conducting the dealing or transaction and the controller\u2019s associates. But if the 2 entities are closely held, the rules also target equity or loan interests held by 2 or more common owners of those entities, the common owner\u2019s associates and any active participants in the arrangement. There are also exclusions and safe harbours that limit the operation of the rules. If the rules apply, you may need to adjust: the cost base and reduced cost base of equity and loan interests affected by the value shift, or a realised loss or gain on the disposal of the relevant assets. In some cases, there may also be an immediate capital gain. For more information, see General value shifting regime \u2013 who it affects . Other special rules There are other rules that may affect the cost base and reduced cost base of an asset. For example, they are calculated differently: if the asset is your main residence and you use it to produce income for the first time after 20\u00a0August 1996, see Real estate and main residence if you receive the asset as a beneficiary or as the legal personal representative of a deceased estate, see Deceased estates for bonus shares or units, rights and options and convertible notes, see Investments in shares and units under a demerger, see Investments in shares and units where you have been freed from paying a debt, see Debt forgiveness below where you start or cease to have a financial arrangement as consideration for acquiring a CGT asset, see Guide to the taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA) for eligible shares in an early stage innovation company (ESIC) that have been continuously held for 10\u00a0years or the subject of certain CGT rollovers, see How does CGT apply to qualifying shares and How does the modified CGT treatment apply to a rollover? . Debt forgiveness A debt is forgiven if you are freed from the obligation to pay it. Commercial debt forgiveness rules apply to debts forgiven after 27\u00a0June 1996.

Under the commercial debt forgiveness rules, a forgiven amount may reduce (in the following order) your: prior income year revenue losses net capital losses from earlier years deductions for capital allowances and some similar deductions assets\u2019 cost base and reduced cost base. These rules do not apply if the debt is forgiven either: as a result of an action under bankruptcy law in a deceased person\u2019s will for reasons of natural love and affection.

Debt forgiveness A debt is forgiven if you are freed from the obligation to pay it. Commercial debt forgiveness rules apply to debts forgiven after 27\u00a0June 1996. A debt is a commercial debt if part or all of the interest payable on the debt is, or would be, an allowable deduction. Under the commercial debt forgiveness rules, a forgiven amount may reduce (in the following order) your: prior income year revenue losses net capital losses from earlier years deductions for capital allowances and some similar deductions assets\u2019 cost base and reduced cost base. These rules do not apply if the debt is forgiven either: as a result of an action under bankruptcy law in a deceased person\u2019s will for reasons of natural love and affection. Nor do the rules apply if: the debt is waived and the waiver constitutes a fringe benefit the amount of debt has been, or will be included in your assessable income in any income year the debt is a tax-related liability. Example 7: Applying a forgiven debt On 1\u00a0July 2022, Josef had available net capital losses from earlier years of $9,000. On 3\u00a0January 2023, he sold shares he had owned for more than 12\u00a0months for $20,000. They had a cost base (no indexation) of $7,500. On 1\u00a0April 2023, a commercial debt of $15,000 that Josef owed to AZC Pty Ltd was forgiven. Josef had no prior income year revenue losses and no deductible capital expenditure. Josef must use part of the forgiven commercial debt amount to wipe out his net capital losses from earlier years and the rest to reduce the cost base of his shares. He works out the amount of net capital gain to include in his assessable income as follows: Adjust net capital losses from earlier years Available net capital losses from earlier years $9,000 less debt forgiveness adjustment $9,000 Adjusted net capital losses from earlier years Nil Adjust cost base Cost base of shares (no indexation) $7,500 less debt forgiveness adjustment $6,000 Adjusted cost base (no indexation) $1,500 Calculate net capital gain Sale of shares $20,000 less adjusted cost base (no indexation) $1,500 less adjusted net capital losses from earlier years Nil Capital gain (eligible for discount) $18,500 less discount percentage (50%) $9,250 Net capital gain $9,250 End of example Acquiring CGT assets Generally, you acquire a CGT asset when you become its owner. You may acquire a CGT asset for the following reasons: Someone else has a CGT event (for example, the transfer of land to you under a contract of sale). If you acquired an asset because of a CGT event, you are generally taken to have acquired the asset at the time of the CGT event. For example, if you enter into a contract to purchase a CGT asset, the time of acquisition is when you enter into the contract. However, if you obtain an asset without entering into a contract, the time of acquisition is when you start being the asset\u2019s owner. Other events or transactions happen that are not the result of someone else having a CGT event. For example, if a company issues or allots shares to you (which is not a CGT event), you acquire the shares when you enter into a contract to acquire them or, if there is no contract, at the time of their issue or allotment. Other special CGT rules apply. For example, if a CGT asset passes to you as a beneficiary of someone who has died, you are taken to have acquired the asset on the date of the person\u2019s death. Also, if you start using your main residence to produce income for the first time after 20\u00a0August 1996, you are taken to have acquired it at its market value at the time it is first used to produce income. Time of acquisition The time at which a CGT asset is acquired is important for 5\u00a0reasons: CGT generally does not apply to assets acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 (pre-CGT assets) different cost base rules apply to assets acquired at different times.

For example, the costs of owning an asset (see Third element: costs of owning the asset ) are not included in the cost base if you acquired it before 21\u00a0August 1991 it determines whether the cost base can be indexed for inflation and the extent of that indexation (see How to work out your capital gain or capital loss ) it determines whether you are eligible for the CGT discount. For example, one requirement is that you need to have owned the CGT asset for at least 12\u00a0months (see How to work out your capital gain or capital loss ) it determines whether you are eligible for modified CGT treatment. For example, a capital gain on eligible shares in an ESIC is disregarded if the shares were held continuously for at least 12\u00a0months but less than 10\u00a0years (see Exemptions and rollovers ). Compensation There can be CGT consequences when you receive compensation. You disregard some capital gains made as a result of you receiving compensation, for example, compensation for personal injury or compensation payable under certain government programs. For details of other compensation you disregard, see Exemptions . You may defer a capital gain made as a result of compensation for the loss, destruction or compulsory acquisition of an asset . A compensation payment may relate to the disposal of, or permanent damage to, an underlying asset. The underlying asset is the most relevant asset to which the compensation amount is most directly related. For example, if you receive compensation for damage to a rental property, the most relevant asset (the underlying asset) is the rental property. If the payment relates to the disposal (in whole or part) of an underlying asset, the compensation is treated as additional capital proceeds for the disposal of that asset. If the payment relates to permanent damage to, or permanent reduction in the value of, an underlying asset, the compensation is treated as a recoupment of all or part of the acquisition cost of the asset (that is, you reduce the cost base and reduced cost base by the amount of the compensation). If the payment is not for an underlying asset, it relates to the disposal of the right to seek compensation. The capital gain or capital loss will be the difference between the incidental costs and the compensation received. For more information, see TR\u00a095/35 Income tax: capital gains: treatment of compensation receipts. Foreign residents, temporary residents and changing residency There are special CGT rules that apply if you are a foreign resident or if you become or stop being an Australian resident. (Unless otherwise specified, \u2018Australian resident\u2019 means a resident of Australia for tax purposes.) There are also specific rules for temporary residents. These rules do not affect pre-CGT assets. For periods when you are a foreign resident or temporary resident only certain assets are subject to CGT. Also, when you become an Australian resident or stop being one, the range of assets on which you pay CGT in Australia changes. You may no longer receive the full 50% discount on capital gains made on taxable Australian property if you are: an individual a beneficiary of a trust, or a partner in a partnership and a foreign or temporary resident, or an Australian resident with a period of foreign residency. For more information, see CGT discount for foreign residents . Foreign residents If you are a foreign resident, you are subject to CGT if a CGT event happens to a CGT asset that is \u2018taxable Australian property\u2019.

For more information, see ESS \u2013 Foreign income exemption for Australian residents and temporary residents . Taxable Australian property Taxable Australian property includes: a direct interest in real property situated in Australia or a mining, prospecting or quarrying right to minerals, petroleum and quarry materials situated in Australia a CGT asset that you have used at any time in carrying on a business through a permanent establishment in Australia an indirect Australian real property interest (which is an interest in an entity, including a foreign entity, where you and your associates hold 10% or more of the entity and the value of your interest is principally attributable to Australian real property). Taxable Australian property also includes an option or right over one of the above. For CGT events happening on or after 20\u00a0May 2009, a leasehold interest in land situated in Australia is 'real property situated in Australia'. Certain CGT assets will also be taken to be taxable Australian property. See Choosing to disregard capital gains and capital losses when you cease being an Australian resident . If you are a foreign resident, or the trustee of a trust that was not a resident trust for CGT purposes, and: you acquired a post-CGT indirect Australian real property interest before 11\u00a0May 2005; and that interest did not have the necessary connection with Australia but is taxable Australian property, you are taken to have acquired it on 10\u00a0May 2005 for its market value on that day. If you are a foreign resident and have entered into a transaction on or after 1\u00a0July 2016 to dispose of a CGT asset of yours that is taxable Australian property, payments made to you in that transaction may be subject to withholding. For more information, see Foreign residents and capital gains tax . Temporary residents Temporary residents are subject to the same CGT rules as foreign residents. However, there are specific rules where the CGT asset is a share or right acquired under an employee share scheme and you are, or have been, a temporary resident. For more information, see ESS \u2013 Foreign income exemption for Australian residents and temporary residents . This means, if you are a temporary resident, you will be subject to CGT on CGT events that happen to taxable Australian property. You are a temporary resident if you: hold a temporary visa granted under the Migration Act 1958 are not an Australian resident within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1991 , and do not have a spouse who is an Australian resident within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1991 . The Social Security Act 1991 defines an Australian resident as a person who resides in Australia and is an Australian citizen, the holder of a permanent visa, or a protected special category visa holder. Anyone who is an Australian resident for tax purposes after 6\u00a0April 2006, but is not a temporary resident, cannot later become a temporary resident, even if they later hold a temporary visa.

For more information, see Taxable Australian property . Exemption for a temporary resident who ceases being an Australian resident If you are a temporary resident when you cease to be an Australian resident, you are not taken to have disposed of any of your assets. Choosing to disregard capital gains and capital losses when you cease being an Australian resident If you are an individual, you can choose to disregard all capital gains and capital losses you made when you stopped being a resident. If you ceased being a resident and make this choice, the assets are taken to be taxable Australian property until the earlier of: a CGT event happening to the assets (for example, their sale or disposal), or you again becoming an Australian resident. The effect of making this choice is that the increase or decrease in value of the assets from the time you cease being a resident to the time of the next CGT event, or of you again becoming a resident, is also taken into account in working out your capital gains or capital losses on those assets. Choices There are a number of provisions in the CGT laws that allow you to make a choice. Some of the provisions allow you to defer or roll over a capital gain you make when a CGT event happens (such as exchanging an asset for a replacement asset) until a later CGT event (such as selling the replacement asset). When and how you make a choice The general rule under CGT law is that you must make a choice by the day you lodge your income tax return for the income year in which the relevant CGT event happened. The way you prepare your tax return is sufficient evidence of your choice. However, there are some exceptions: companies must make some decisions about replacement asset rollovers earlier choices relating to amounts disregarded under the small business retirement exemption must be made in writing choices relating to the assessment of capital gains of resident testamentary trusts must be made by a trustee within a specific period. Once you make such a choice, it cannot be changed. Your choice is binding. However, there are some circumstances when we consider that you have not made a choice. These are if you lodge your tax return without being aware that: events have happened that required you to make a choice, or a choice was available. In these circumstances, we may allow you more time to make a choice.

Each case is decided on its own merits. How to request an extension of time to make a choice If you have lodged a tax return without knowing a choice was available to you under CGT law and you want to find out how to make a request for more time to make the choice, see Applying for an extension on a capital gain rollover . Examples of choices available under capital gains tax CGT choices you can make include: You may use the indexation method rather than the CGT discount method if a CGT event happens to a CGT asset you acquired before 21\u00a0September 1999 (or are taken to have acquired before that date for the purpose of using those methods). See Choosing the indexation or discount method . You may make a capital loss for the income year in which a liquidator or administrator declares in writing that shares or securities held in a company are worthless. See Shares in a company in liquidation or administration . You may roll over a capital gain if a company in which you hold shares is taken over and you receive shares in the takeover company and the takeover meets certain conditions. This is known as a scrip for scrip rollover. It can also apply if a trust or fund in which you hold units is taken over and you receive units in the takeover trust or fund. The company, trust or fund will usually advise investors if the conditions for rollover are met. See Scrip for scrip rollover . You may roll over a capital gain if you hold shares in a company that demerges (or splits), you receive shares in the demerged company, and the demerger meets certain conditions. A rollover can also apply if you hold units in a trust or fund that demerges and you receive units in the demerged trust or fund. The head company or head trust or fund will usually advise investors if the conditions for a rollover are met. See Demergers . You may rollover a capital gain if you receive money or property (or both) as compensation for the loss or destruction of an asset or for the compulsory acquisition of property if certain conditions are met. See Loss, destruction or compulsory acquisition of an asset . You may treat a dwelling as your main residence even though you no longer live in it (see Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence ), or you are yet to live in it but will do so as soon as practicable after it is constructed, repaired or renovated and will continue to live in it for at least 3 months (see Constructing, renovating or repairing a dwelling on land you already own ). You make the choice when you prepare your income tax return for the income year in which you enter into the contract to sell the dwelling. If you own both: the dwelling that you can choose to treat as your main residence for one of the periods above, and the dwelling you actually lived in during that period then you make the choice for the income year in which you enter into the contract to sell the first of those dwellings. Exemptions and rollovers There are exemptions and rollovers that may allow you to reduce, defer or disregard your capital gain or capital loss. If you have to complete a CGT schedule, you may need to provide information regarding the capital gains reduced or disregarded. See Part\u00a0B for individuals or Part\u00a0C for companies, trusts and funds. There is no general rollover or exemption for a capital gain you make when you sell an asset and: put the proceeds into a superannuation fund use the proceeds to purchase an identical or similar asset, or transfer an asset into a superannuation fund. For example, if you sell a rental property and put the proceeds into a superannuation fund, or use the proceeds to purchase another rental property, a rollover is not available.

If: on or before 23\u00a0October 2015 you were a Norfolk Island resident acquired and held the CGT asset, and any capital gain or loss from a CGT event in relation to the asset would have been disregarded (because you were a Norfolk Island resident) if the CGT event in relation to the asset had instead happened immediately before 24\u00a0October 2015 then the references in this guide to 20\u00a0September 1985 apply in relation to the asset as if they were references to 24\u00a0October 2015. For more information, see Norfolk Island tax and super . Other exemptions: granny flat arrangements From 1\u00a0July 2021, no CGT event arises to eligible individuals on certain granny flat arrangements if the arrangement satisfies the requirements of the provisions. The CGT exemption will apply to the creation, variation or termination of a granny flat arrangement. There are requirements that need to be satisfied for the CGT event not to happen: The individual is eligible for the granny flat interest if they have reached pension age External Link or have a disability that means they require assistance for most day-to-day activities for at least 12\u00a0months. An individual owns the dwelling where the granny flat interest is held, or is to be held, at the time of entering into or varying the arrangement, or agrees to acquire such a dwelling under the arrangement. Both the individual who is to hold the granny flat interest, and the individual who owns or agrees to acquire the dwelling where the granny flat interest is to be held, are parties to the arrangement. The arrangement is in writing and indicates an intention for the parties to be legally bound by it. The arrangement is not of a commercial nature. Granny flat interest A \u2018granny flat interest\u2019 in a dwelling is a right (put in place under a granny flat arrangement) to occupy that dwelling for life. A granny flat interest does not have to relate to properties often referred to as \u2018granny flats\u2019 as it is not a description of the type of property. An individual can have a granny flat interest in a wide range of properties, such as a family home, or a family\u2019s rental property or holiday home. The property that an individual has the right to occupy for life will not change its CGT status as a result of the granny flat arrangement. For example, if the property is eligible for the main residence exemption, the granny flat arrangement will not change this. If the property is not eligible for the main residence exemption, a granny flat arrangement will not make it eligible. This is because the asset arising from the granny flat arrangement is the right to occupy a property, not the property itself. Dwelling Under this measure, the term refers to the dwelling the individual has the right to occupy because of the granny flat interest. \u2018Dwelling\u2019 is a unit of accommodation, such as a residential home, and includes the land beneath the home.

CGT and foreign exchange gains and losses A CGT asset can be denominated in a foreign currency and foreign currency cash itself can be a CGT asset. Gains or losses that you make during the period that you hold such assets will generally be taxed as a capital gain or capital loss respectively. However, if dealings with foreign currency denominated assets give rise to rights to receive or obligations to pay foreign currency, the rights or obligations may be subject to the foreign exchange (forex) provisions when a right or obligation ceases. For example, if a contract you enter into to sell an overseas rental property is denominated in foreign currency, you will have a right to receive foreign currency (being the sale price of the rental property). The right ceases on payment of the foreign currency. Such rights and obligations will usually arise on the acquisition or disposal of a CGT asset. A forex gain or loss commonly arises for the acquisition or disposal of a CGT asset denominated in foreign currency, where there is a currency exchange rate fluctuation between the date you entered into the contract and the date of settlement of the contract (when payment occurs). Currency fluctuations between the date of acquisition and date of disposal of a CGT asset are taken into account when the cost base and capital proceeds are translated into Australian currency. It may be that the gain or loss you make on the ending of rights for foreign currency, a disposal of foreign currency or a right to receive foreign currency is taxable under both CGT and the forex measures. Generally, to the extent that both the forex measures and CGT bring to account a forex gain or loss, the forex measures take precedence. That is the forex gain or loss is brought to account only under the forex provisions. In addition, if the TOFA rules apply to you, your foreign exchange gains and losses may be brought to account under those TOFA rules instead of the forex measures. For more information, see Guide to the taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA) . Short-term foreign exchange gains and losses rules Some short-term foreign exchange (forex) gains or losses will be treated as capital gains or capital losses. This arises under transactions for the acquisition or disposal of certain CGT assets. In such cases, CGT events K10 or K11 will happen, which will result in the forex gain or loss being integrated into the tax treatment of the CGT asset. Or they are matched to the character of the gain or loss that would arise from the disposal of the asset. For the short-term rules to apply, the due date for payment must be within 12\u00a0months of acquiring or disposing of the asset. For more information, see Capital assets and the 12-month rule . Translating (converting) foreign currency denominated CGT assets to Australian dollars For information on what exchange rates to use in translating foreign currency amounts into Australian currency, see Translation (conversion) rules . Examples of the application of forex rules to CGT assets For examples of the application of the forex rules to acquisitions and disposals of foreign currency denominated CGT assets, see Common forex transactions . CGT and depreciating assets Under the uniform capital allowance (UCA) system, a capital gain or capital loss may arise from the disposal of a depreciating asset. It will only arise to the extent that you have used the asset for a non-taxable purpose (for example, for private purposes). You calculate a capital gain or capital loss from a depreciating asset used for a non-taxable purpose using the UCA concepts of cost and termination value. You do not use the concepts of capital proceeds and cost base found in the CGT provisions. If a balancing adjustment event occurs for a depreciating asset that you have at some time used for a non-taxable purpose, a CGT event happens. See CGT event K7 in appendix\u00a01. The most common balancing adjustment event for a depreciating asset occurs when you stop holding it (for example, you sell, lose or destroy it) or stop using it. Calculating a capital gain or capital loss for a depreciating asset You make a capital gain if the termination value of your depreciating asset is greater than its cost. You make a capital loss if the reverse is the case, that is, the asset\u2019s cost is more than its termination value.

If a balancing adjustment event occurs for a depreciating asset that you have at some time used for a non-taxable purpose, a CGT event happens. See CGT event K7 in appendix\u00a01. The most common balancing adjustment event for a depreciating asset occurs when you stop holding it (for example, you sell, lose or destroy it) or stop using it. Calculating a capital gain or capital loss for a depreciating asset You make a capital gain if the termination value of your depreciating asset is greater than its cost. You make a capital loss if the reverse is the case, that is, the asset\u2019s cost is more than its termination value. You use different formulas to calculate a capital gain or capital loss depending on whether the asset is in a low-value pool or not. Depreciating asset not in a low-value pool: capital gain If your depreciating asset is not a pooled asset, you calculate the capital gain as follows: (termination value \u2212 cost) \u00d7 (sum of reductions note\u00a01 \u00f7 total decline note\u00a02 ) Depreciating asset not in a low-value pool: capital loss You calculate the capital loss from a depreciating asset that is not a pooled asset as follows: (cost \u2212 termination value) \u00d7 (sum of reductions ( note\u00a01 \u00f7 total decline note\u00a02 ) Example 8: Capital gain on depreciating asset Larry purchased a truck in August 2021 for $25,000 and sold it in June 2023 for $27,000. He used the truck 10% of the time for private purposes. The decline in value of the truck under the UCA system up to the date of sale was $2,000. Therefore, the sum of his reductions relating to his private use is $200 (10% of $2,000). Larry calculates his capital gain from CGT event K7 as follows: ($27,000 \u2212 $25,000) \u00d7 (200 \u00f7 2,000) Capital gain from CGT event K7 = $200 (before applying any discount). End of example Depreciating asset in a low-value pool: capital gain You calculate the capital gain from a depreciating asset in a low-value pool as follows: (termination value \u2212 cost) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 taxable use fraction ( note\u00a03 )) Depreciating asset in a low-value pool: capital loss You calculate the capital loss from a depreciating asset in a low-value pool as follows: (cost \u2212 termination value) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 taxable use fraction ( note\u00a03 )) Notes The sum of the reductions in your deductions for the asset\u2019s decline in value that is attributable to your use of the asset, or having it installed ready for use, for a non-taxable purpose. The decline in the value of the depreciating asset since you started to hold it. Taxable use fraction is the percentage of the asset\u2019s use that is for producing your assessable income, expressed as a fraction. This is the percentage you reasonably estimate at the time you allocated the asset to the low-value pool. Application of CGT concessions A capital gain from a depreciating asset may qualify for the CGT discount if the relevant conditions are satisfied. If the CGT discount applies, there is no reduction of the capital gain under the indexation method. The small business CGT concessions do not apply to a capital gain made from the disposal of a depreciating asset.

Application of CGT concessions A capital gain from a depreciating asset may qualify for the CGT discount if the relevant conditions are satisfied. If the CGT discount applies, there is no reduction of the capital gain under the indexation method. The small business CGT concessions do not apply to a capital gain made from the disposal of a depreciating asset. This is because a capital gain can only arise out of such an asset\u2019s use for non-taxable purposes (for example, to the extent it is used for private purposes). For more information, see How to work out your capital gain or capital loss . Do any CGT exemptions apply to a depreciating asset? Exemptions may apply to a capital gain or capital loss made from the disposal of a depreciating asset: pre-CGT assets \u2013 you disregard a capital gain or capital loss from a depreciating asset if the asset was acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 assets of small business entities - you disregard a capital gain or capital loss from a depreciating asset if you are a small business entity and you can deduct an amount for the depreciating asset\u2019s decline in value under the small business entity capital allowance provisions for the income year in which the balancing adjustment event occurred personal use asset if a depreciating asset is a personal use asset (that is, one used or kept mainly for personal use and enjoyment), you disregard any capital loss from CGT event K7 you also disregard a capital gain under CGT event K7 from a personal use asset costing $10,000 or less collectables \u2013 you disregard a capital gain or a capital loss from a depreciating asset that is a collectable costing $500 or less balancing adjustment event and CGT event - you only include a balancing adjustment event that gives rise to a capital gain or capital loss under CGT event K7. However, capital proceeds received under other CGT events (for example, CGT event\u00a0D1 ) may still be relevant for a depreciating asset as CGT events are not the equivalent of balancing adjustment events. Treatment of intellectual property Under the capital allowance rules, intellectual property is a depreciating asset. If you grant or assign an interest in an item of intellectual property, you are treated as if you had stopped holding part of the item. You are also treated as if, just before you stop holding that part, you had split the original item of intellectual property into 2\u00a0parts. That is, the part you stopped holding and the rest of the original item. You determine a first element of the cost for each part. This treatment applies if a licence is granted over an item of intellectual property. To this extent, the treatment of intellectual property is different from other depreciating assets. The granting of a licence in respect of other depreciating assets would result in CGT event\u00a0D1 (about creating contractual rights) happening.

Menu Search Eligibility for main residence exemption Check if you qualify for the main residence exemption and whether your home is considered a dwelling. Last updated 6 July 2023 Print or Download Eligibility conditions Your main residence (your home) is exempt from CGT if you are an Australian resident and the dwelling: has been the home of you, your partner and other dependants for the whole period you have owned it has not been used to produce income \u2013 that is, you have not run a business from it, rented it out or 'flipped' it (bought it to renovate and sell at a profit) is on land of 2\u00a0hectares or less. If you meet these conditions, you do not pay tax on any capital gain when you sell your home and you ignore any capital loss. If you do not meet all these conditions, you may still be entitled to a partial exemption. You can work out the proportion that is exempt using the CGT property exemption tool. CGT property exemption tool For a summary fact sheet with common scenarios about CGT and eligibility for the main residence exemption that you can download as a PDF, see Capital gains tax and the main residence exemption . What is a main residence? Generally, a dwelling is considered to be your main residence if: you and your family live in it your personal belongings are in it it is the address your mail is delivered to it is your address on the electoral roll services such as gas and power are connected. The length of time you stay in the dwelling and whether you intend to occupy it as your home may also be relevant. To be your main residence, your property must have a dwelling on it and you must have lived in it. You are not entitled to the exemption for a vacant block. What is a dwelling? A dwelling is anything used wholly or mainly for residential accommodation, such as: a house or cottage an apartment or flat a strata title unit a unit in a retirement village a caravan, houseboat or other mobile home. A flat or home unit often includes areas that are physically separate, such as a laundry, storeroom or garage. They are exempt from CGT on the same basis as the flat or unit. However, if you dispose of one of these structures separately from the flat or home unit (for example, you sell the garage), they are not exempt from CGT unless they were compulsorily acquired. Foreign residents If you were not a resident of Australia for tax purposes while you were living in the property, you are unlikely to satisfy the requirements for the main residence exemption. If you are a foreign resident when a CGT event happens to your residential property in Australia (for example, you sell it), you may not be entitled to claim the main residence exemption. Check if you qualify for the main residence exemption and whether your home is considered a dwelling.

Menu Search Home on more than 2 hectares Choose which part of your property is exempt from CGT if it is larger than 2 hectares. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download Which part of your land is exempt When selling your home you can claim the main residence exemption from capital gains tax (CGT) for up to 2\u00a0hectares of the land your home is on. If your land is used for private purposes and is greater than 2\u00a0hectares, you can choose which 2\u00a0hectares are exempt. The rest is subject to CGT. If any part of the land is used to produce income it is not exempt. This is the case even if the total land area is less than 2\u00a0hectares. The 2\u00a0hectares you choose must include the land that is under your dwelling. Example: land used for private purposes Mohammed bought a house with 15\u00a0hectares of land. He used 10\u00a0hectares for apple farming and 5\u00a0hectares for private purposes. Mohammed can get the main residence exemption for: the house 2\u00a0hectares of land he selects out of the 5\u00a0hectares that he uses for private purposes (the land he selects must include the land under the house). After 9\u00a0years, Mohammed decided to sell. He had his house valued. The valuation stated that the house and the 2\u00a0hectares of land he had selected were worth two-thirds of the total value of the property. Mohammed can claim the main residence exemption for two-thirds of the capital gain on the sale of the property. End of example Selling land separately from dwelling If you sell land separately from your dwelling it is subject to CGT unless either: your dwelling has been accidentally destroyed and you sell the vacant land vacant land adjacent to your dwelling is compulsorily acquired If the dwelling is not sold with the land \u2013 for example, because the dwelling is a caravan and has been removed or sold separately \u2013 the sale of the land is subject to CGT. Choose which part of your property is exempt from CGT if it is larger than 2\u00a0hectares.

Menu Search How to work out your capital gain or capital loss Last updated 9 July 2023 Print or Download Explains how to work out each capital gain or capital loss you made during 2022\u201323. Overview It does not explain how to work out your net capital gain or net capital losses carried forward to later income years. If you are completing the Tax return for individuals (supplementary section) 2023 and want more information on how to calculate your net capital gain for 2022\u201323 or net capital losses carried forward to later income years (including how to deduct any unapplied net capital losses from earlier years), see part\u00a0B of this guide. For more information about companies, trusts and funds or about completing the CGT summary worksheet , see part\u00a0C of this guide. Methods of calculating capital gains There are 3 methods that are used to calculate a capital gain: the 'other' method the indexation method the discount method There is only one way to calculate a capital loss. The 3 methods of calculating capital gains are summarised and compared in Table\u00a02 below. They are explained in more detail in the following pages. In some cases, you may be able to choose either the discount method or the indexation method to calculate your capital gain. In these cases, you can use the method that gives you the better result. The CGT summary worksheet for 2023 tax returns shows the 3 methods of calculating a capital gain. You are not obliged to use this worksheet, but you may find it helps you calculate your capital gain or capital loss for each CGT event. Table 2: Capital gain calculation methods Method type Indexation method Discount method 'other' method Description of method Allows you to increase the cost base by applying an indexation factor based on CPI up to September 1999 Allows you to discount your capital gain Basic method of subtracting the cost base from the capital proceeds When can you use the method For an asset owned for 12\u00a0months or more. Use only for assets acquired before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999. For an asset owned for 12\u00a0months or more You must use when the indexation and discount methods do not apply (for example, if you have bought and sold an asset within 12\u00a0months). How to calculate your capital gain using the method Apply the relevant indexation factor, see CPI table at appendix\u00a02 , then subtract the indexed cost base from the capital proceeds, see worked example\u00a013 . Subtract the cost base from the capital proceeds, deduct any capital losses, then reduce by the relevant discount percentage, see worked example\u00a013 . Subtract the cost base (or the amount specified by the relevant CGT event) from the capital proceeds, see worked example\u00a09 . The 'other' method This is the simplest of the 3 methods. You must use the 'other' method to calculate your capital gain if you have bought and sold your asset within 12\u00a0months or generally for CGT events that do not involve an asset. In these cases, the indexation and discount methods do not apply. Generally, to use the 'other' method, you simply subtract your cost base (what the asset cost you) from your capital proceeds (how much you sold it for). The amount of proceeds left is your capital gain. For some types of CGT events, a cost base is not relevant. See appendix\u00a01 for the amounts to use. Example 9: Calculating a capital gain using the 'other' method Marie-Anne bought a property for $250,000 under a contract dated 23\u00a0June 2022. The contract provided for the payment of a deposit of $25,000 on that date, with the balance of $225,000 to be paid on settlement on 4\u00a0August 2022.

The contract provided for the payment of a deposit of $25,000 on that date, with the balance of $225,000 to be paid on settlement on 4\u00a0August 2022. Marie-Anne paid stamp duty of $5,000 on 20\u00a0July 2022. On 4\u00a0August 2022, she received an account for solicitor's fees of $2,000 which she paid as part of the settlement process. Marie-Anne sold the property on 16\u00a0October 2022 (the day the contracts were exchanged) for $315,000. She incurred costs of $1,500 in solicitor's fees and $4,000 in agent\u2019s commission. As she bought and sold her property within 12\u00a0months, Marie-Anne must use the 'other' method to calculate her capital gain. Deposit $25,000 Balance $225,000 Stamp duty $5,000 Solicitor's fees for purchase of property $2,000 Solicitor's fees for sale of property $1,500 Agent's commission $4,000 Cost base (total) $262,500 Marie-Anne works out her capital gain as follows: Capital proceeds $315,000 less cost base $262,500 Capital gain calculated using the 'other' method $52,500 Assuming Marie-Anne has not made any other capital losses or capital gains in 2022\u201323, and does not have any unapplied net capital losses from earlier years, the net capital gain to be included at question 18 in her Tax return for individuals (supplementary section) 2023 is $52,500. End of example The indexation method Use the indexation method to calculate your capital gain if: a CGT event happened to an asset you acquired before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999, and you owned the asset for 12\u00a0months or more. If you are not a company and you meet the 2 conditions above and you wish to use the indexation method, you must choose to do so, otherwise the discount method will apply. If you are a company (other than a listed investment company) and the capital gain meets the conditions listed above, you must use the indexation method to calculate the capital gain. Specific rules affect certain assets of a life insurance company. Under the indexation method, you increase each amount included in an element of the cost base (other than those in the third element, costs of owning the asset) by an indexation factor. The indexation factor is worked out using the consumer price index (CPI) at appendix\u00a02 . If the CGT event happened on or after 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999, you can only index the elements of your cost base up to 30\u00a0September 1999. You use this formula: A = B \u00f7 C Where: A is the indexation factor B is CPI for the quarter ending September 1999 (68.7) C is CPI for the quarter in which expenditure was incurred If the CGT event happened before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999, you use this formula: A = B \u00f7 C Where: A is the indexation factor B is CPI for the quarter when CGT event happened C is CPI for the quarter in which expenditure was incurred Work out the indexation factor to 3 decimal places, rounding up if the 4th decimal place is 5 or more.

However, there is an exception for partly paid shares or units acquired on or after 16\u00a0August 1989. If the company or trust later makes a call on the shares or units, you use the CPI for the quarter in which you made that later payment. There are some exceptions to the requirement that you must have owned an asset for at least 12\u00a0months for indexation to apply. For example, you can use the indexation method if: you acquire a CGT asset as a legal personal representative or a beneficiary of a deceased estate. The 12-month requirement is satisfied if the deceased acquired the asset 12\u00a0months or more before you disposed of it, or you acquired an asset as the result of a marriage or relationship breakdown. You will satisfy the 12-month requirement if the combined period your spouse and you owned the asset is more than 12\u00a0months. The discount method Use the discount method to calculate your capital gain if: you are an individual, a trust or a complying superannuation entity a CGT event happens to an asset you own the CGT event happened after 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999 you acquired the asset at least 12\u00a0months before the CGT event you did not choose to use the indexation method. Generally, the discount method does not apply to companies, although it can apply to a limited number of capital gains made by life insurance companies. In determining whether you acquired the CGT asset at least 12\u00a0months before the CGT event, you exclude both the day of acquisition and the day of the CGT event. You can use the discount method to work out your capital gain from the property if you: acquire a property and construct a building or make improvements to it that are not separate assets (see Separate assets ) owned the property for at least 12\u00a0months (even if you did not construct the new building or improvements more than 12\u00a0months before the CGT event happened). Example 10: Discount method Sally acquired a CGT asset on 2\u00a0February 2022. She is entitled to apply the CGT discount if a CGT event happened to that asset on or after 3\u00a0February 2023. End of example In certain circumstances, you may be eligible for the CGT discount even if you have not owned the asset for at least 12\u00a0months. For example: You acquire a CGT asset as a legal personal representative or as a beneficiary of a deceased estate. The 12-month requirement is satisfied if the asset was acquired by the deceased before 20\u00a0September 1985 and you disposed of it 12\u00a0months or more after they died, or on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 and you disposed of it 12\u00a0months or more after they acquired it. You acquired a CGT asset as the result of a marriage or relationship breakdown and rollover applies. You will satisfy the 12-month requirement if the combined period your spouse and you owned the asset was more than 12\u00a0months. A CGT asset was compulsorily acquired, lost or destroyed and you acquired a rollover replacement asset, you will satisfy the 12-month requirement for the replacement asset if the period of ownership of the original asset and the replacement asset was at least 12\u00a0months. Certain capital gains are excluded The CGT discount does not apply to capital gains from certain CGT events.

The full list of CGT events is shown at Appendix\u00a01 . If you make a capital gain from a CGT event that creates a new asset (for example, receiving a payment for agreeing not to do something; that is, entering into a restrictive covenant) you cannot satisfy the 12-month ownership rule, so your CGT event does not qualify for the CGT discount. The CGT discount may be denied: if the CGT event that gave rise to the capital gain occurred under an agreement that was made within 12\u00a0months of the acquisition of the asset on the disposal of certain shares or trust interests in non-widely held companies and trusts, that is, those with fewer than 300 members if an arrangement was entered into for the purposes of claiming the CGT discount under which an \u2018income\u2019 asset was converted into a \u2018capital\u2019 asset (conversion of income to capital) (Part\u00a0IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ). If the home first used to produce income rule applies and the period between when you first used the dwelling to produce income and the CGT event happening is not at least 12\u00a0months, the discount method is not available. Discount percentage The discount percentage is the percentage by which you reduce your capital gain. You can reduce the capital gain only after you have applied all the capital losses for 2022\u201323 and any unapplied net capital losses from earlier years. The discount percentage is 50% for individuals and trusts, and 33\u2153% for complying superannuation entities and eligible life insurance companies. You may no longer receive the full 50% discount on capital gains made on taxable Australian property if you are: an individual a beneficiary of a trust, or a partner in a partnership and a foreign or temporary resident, or an Australian resident with a period of foreign residency. An additional CGT discount of up to 10% may be available to Australian resident individuals who provide affordable rental housing to people earning low to moderate income. This increases the CGT discount percentage to up to 60% for qualifying owners of these residential rental properties. To qualify, you must have provided affordable housing: on or after 1\u00a0January 2018 for a period or periods totalling at least 3\u00a0years (1,095\u00a0days), which may be aggregate usage over different periods; and either directly, or from a trust including where there is an interposed entity between you and the trust. The trust that provides the affordable housing and any interposed entities may be a trust, a managed investment trust or partnership, but cannot be a public unit trust or superannuation fund. The number of days you may have provided affordable housing before 1\u00a0January 2018 will not be counted. For more information, see CGT discount for foreign residents . Choosing the indexation or discount method For assets you acquired before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999 and have held for 12\u00a0months or more, you can choose to use the indexation method or the discount method to calculate your capital gain. There is no one factor to use as a basis to select the better option as it depends on: the type of asset you own how long you have owned it the dates you owned it past rates of inflation. Because capital losses must be offset against capital gains before the discount is applied, your choice may also depend on the amount of capital losses that you have available. For more information, see Choices .

Example 11: Comparison of discount and indexation methods Justin sold some land and has a $10,000 capital gain under the discount method (before applying the CGT discount) or a $7,000 capital gain under the indexation method. If Justin has no capital losses, the discount method will produce the smaller capital gain (that is, $5,000). However, Justin also made a capital loss of $5,000 on the sale of some shares. He will be better off using the indexation method to work out the capital gain from the sale of his land. Under this method, his net capital gain is $2,000 (that is, $7,000 minus $5,000). If he used the discount method, his net capital gain would be $2,500 (that is $10,000 minus $5,000, multiplied by 50%). End of example Example 12 shows that applying one method to work out your capital gains on a whole parcel of shares you acquired before September 1999 may not be to your advantage if you have capital losses or net capital losses to apply. In this situation, you will get a better result if you apply the indexation method to sufficient shares to absorb the capital loss (or as much of the capital loss as you can) and apply the discount method to any remaining shares. Example 12: Capital gains on shares where you also have capital losses Clare sold a parcel of 500 shares in March 2023 for $12,500, that is, for $25\u00a0each. She had acquired the shares in March 1995 for $7,500, that is, for $15\u00a0each, including stamp duty and brokerage. There was no brokerage on the sale. Clare had no other capital gains or capital losses in 2022\u201323, although she has $3,500 net capital losses carried forward from previous income years. Because Clare owned the shares for more than 12\u00a0months she can use the discount method or the indexation method to work out her capital gains, whichever gives her a better result. Clare decides to work out her net capital gain by applying both the discount method and the indexation method to the whole parcel of shares: Comparison of indexation and discount methods Calculation element Using indexation method $ Using discount method $ Capital proceeds 12,500 12,500 Cost base 8,077 (see note\u00a01 ) (acquisition cost \u00d7 indexation factor) 7,500 Capital gain 4,423 5,000 less capital losses 3,500 3,500 Subtotal 923 1,500 CGT discount Nil 750 Net capital gain 923 750 Note 1: $7,500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.077 (indexation factor is 68.7\u00a0\u00f7\u00a063.8 = 1.077) However, because each share is a separate asset, Clare can use different methods to work out her capital gains for shares within the parcel. The lowest net capital gain would result from her applying the indexation method to the sale of 395 (see note\u00a02 below) shares, and the discount method to the remaining 105\u00a0shares.", "start_char_idx": 13573, "end_char_idx": 16916, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e18de5f-c719-4412-8599-3bc91ea532ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e18de5f-c719-4412-8599-3bc91ea532ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/how-to-work-out-your-capital-gain-or-capital-loss?anchor=How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap#How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap.md", "file_name": "how-to-work-out-your-capital-gain-or-capital-loss?anchor=How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap#How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 23802, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cae10e70-a023-4ed3-9ff3-6b240e941028", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/how-to-work-out-your-capital-gain-or-capital-loss?anchor=How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap#How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap.md", "file_name": "how-to-work-out-your-capital-gain-or-capital-loss?anchor=How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap#How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 23802, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "9649670ab685ff94fe76370e8c50a028f9efa70eb2d239a17c08694bb5d1849d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6527893b-7b44-49a3-86a6-59dae306635c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/how-to-work-out-your-capital-gain-or-capital-loss?anchor=How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap#How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap.md", "file_name": "how-to-work-out-your-capital-gain-or-capital-loss?anchor=How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap#How_to_work_out_your_capital_gain_or_cap.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 23802, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "ad8f4dd045170f53d62165e65be0e54ca5cbf33e08a567d2b6e5f94459ad345b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7e83cb7d-d61c-4dfb-97b5-e1f99fc31a94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "06371f36a4fe0b07e7fbe82fbdd243ba28aa8e54cdf9271f374dd91275b0a75f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9fda95fd57a9233ee3d02895dddaffb7942dbbdd3c613fa9c2a24e63185b22c7", "text": "The lowest net capital gain would result from her applying the indexation method to the sale of 395 (see note\u00a02 below) shares, and the discount method to the remaining 105\u00a0shares.

End of example You can choose to calculate your capital gain using both methods to find out which gives you the better result. This is shown for Val in example\u00a013 and in the completed Capital gain or capital loss worksheet 2023 . Example 13: Choosing the indexation or discount method Val bought a property for $150,000 under a contract dated 24\u00a0June 1991. The contract provided for the payment of a deposit of $15,000 on that date, with the balance of $135,000 to be paid on settlement on 5\u00a0August 1991. She paid stamp duty of $5,000 on 20\u00a0July 1991. On 5\u00a0August 1991, she received an account for solicitor's fees of $2,000, which she paid as part of the settlement process. She sold the property on 15\u00a0October 2022 (the day the contracts were exchanged) for $350,000. She incurred costs of $1,500 in solicitor's fees and $4,000 in agent's commission.

Val\u2019s capital gain calculated using the discount method Deposit $15,000 Balance $135,000 Stamp duty $5,000 Solicitor's fees for purchase of property $2,000 Solicitor's fees for sale of property $1,500 Agent's commission $4,000 Cost base (total) $162,500 Val works out her capital gain as follows: Capital proceeds $350,000 less cost base $162,500 Capital gain before applying discount (Val\u2019s total current year capital gain using this method) $187,500 less CGT discount (as Val has no capital losses) $93,750 Net capital gain $93,750 Val considers the discount method gives her the better result. Val will write the amount worked out using the discount method on her tax return rather than the amount worked out using the indexation method. The Capital gain or capital loss worksheet 2023 shows how Val might complete the worksheet using both methods.

Menu Search Keeping records of shares and units How to identify which shares you have sold, when you acquired them, and the records you need. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download Records you need to keep When you sell your shares in companies or units in managed funds, most of the records you need will be given to you by the company, the fund manager or your stockbroker. These records generally include: the date of purchase the purchase amount details of any non-assessable payments made to you the date and amount of any calls (if shares were partly paid) the sale price (if you sell them) any commissions paid to brokers when you buy or sell details of events such as share splits, share consolidations, returns of capital, takeovers, mergers, demergers and bonus share issues. You may buy parcels of shares in the same company at different times. You need to keep details for each parcel as they are separate CGT assets. Identifying when shares or units were acquired When you sell only some of your shares or units in a company or trust, you need to be able to identify which ones you have sold and when you acquired them. This is important because shares or units bought at different times may have different costs. This will affect your capital gain or loss. Share transactions through the Australian Stock Exchange are recorded in the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS). If you have the relevant records from your CHESS holding statement or your issuer sponsored statement, you can select which shares you have sold and identify their cost. Example: identifying when shares or units were acquired Boris is an investor. He: bought 1,000 shares in a company in 2021 for $5\u00a0each bought 3,000 shares in the same company in 2022 for $10\u00a0each sold 1,500 of the shares in 2023 for $8 each. Boris must decide which of his shares in the company he is selling and which he is retaining. He decides to sell 1,500 of the shares he bought in 2022 in order to claim a capital loss in the 2023 income year. As a result, Boris will still have: 1,000 shares with an acquisition cost of $5 1,500 shares with an acquisition cost of $10. If Boris later decides to sell more of his shares in the company, he can choose which of his remaining shares he is selling. Boris should keep records of which shares he has bought and sold so he can show that he has calculated CGT correctly on any sales of shares.

Menu Search Living separately to your spouse or children How to use the main residence exemption if you live in a different home to your spouse or children. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download Having a different home from your dependent child If you and a dependent child under 18\u00a0years of age have different homes for a period, for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes you must choose one of the homes as the main residence for both of you for the period. Having a different home from your spouse If you and your spouse have different homes for a period, for CGT purposes you and your spouse must either: choose one of the homes as the main residence for both of you for the period each nominate one of the different homes as your main residence for the period. If you nominate different homes for the period and you own 50% or less of the home you have nominated, you qualify for an exemption for your share. If you own more than 50%, your share is exempt for half the period you and your spouse have different homes. The same rule applies to your spouse. This rule applies to each main residence the spouses nominate, whether they have sole ownership or own the home jointly (either as joint tenants or tenants in common). Example: spouses with different main residences On 1\u00a0July 1998 Kathy and her spouse Grahame settled the purchase of a townhouse and moved in together. Grahame owned 70% of the townhouse and Kathy owned the other 30%. On 1\u00a0August 2000 they settled the purchase of a beach house, which they owned in equal shares. From 1\u00a0May 2001: Kathy lived in their beach house and nominated it as her main residence. Grahame kept living in the townhouse and nominated it as his main residence. On 15\u00a0April\u00a02023 Kathy and Grahame settled the sale of both the townhouse and beach house. Beach house As the beach house was Kathy's main residence and she owned 50% of it, she disregards her share of any capital gain or loss for the period she and Grahame had different homes (1\u00a0May 2001 to 15\u00a0April 2023). As Grahame did not live in the beach house or nominate it as his main residence when he and Kathy had different homes, he includes his share of any capital gain or loss for any of the period he owned it. Townhouse The total capital gain on the sale of the townhouse was $100,000. Grahame's share of the capital gain is $70,000 (reflecting his 70% ownership interest). Because Grahame owned more than 50% of the townhouse, it is taken to have been his main residence for half of the period when he and Kathy had different homes. He is entitled to the main residence exemption for the entire period that he and Kathy lived together in the townhouse. The amount of the gain that Grahame disregards under the main residence exemption is: his share of capital gain multiplied by: days spouses have one main residence divided by: total days property owned equals: gain disregarded for period that spouses have one main residence That is: $70,000 \u00d7 (1,035 days \u00f7 9,055 days) = $8,001 plus share of capital gain multiplied by: 50% multiplied by: days spouses have separate main residences divided by: total days property owned equals: gain disregarded for period that spouses have separate main residences That is: $70,000 \u00d7 50% \u00d7 (8,020 days \u00f7 9,054 days) = $30,999 The total amount disregarded by Grahame is: $8,001\u00a0+\u00a0$30,999 = $39,000 Grahame's capital gain on the townhouse is therefore: $70,000 \u2212 $39,000 = $31,000 Kathy's share of the $100,000 capital gain on the townhouse is $30,000, reflecting her 30% ownership interest.

(For the townhouse, which was bought before 21\u00a0September 1999, they have the option of indexing the cost base instead of using the discount.) End of example This rule also applies if you choose to treat a property as your main residence after you move out , and this choice results in you having a different main residence from your spouse or a dependent child for a period. Example: different main residences and continuing main residence On 5\u00a0February 1999 Anna and her spouse Mark bought a townhouse and moved in together. Anna owned more than 50% of the townhouse. Before moving into the townhouse Anna had lived alone in her own flat. After moving into the townhouse she rented out her flat. On 11\u00a0March 2000 Anna sold her flat. She chose to treat the flat as her main residence from 5\u00a0February 1999 until she sold it, under the 'continuing main residence status after moving out' rule. On 29\u00a0April 2023 Anna and Mark sold their townhouse. Because of Anna's choice, Mark had a different main residence from Anna for the period 5\u00a0February 1999 to 11\u00a0March 2000. Therefore, Mark must either: treat Anna's flat as his main residence for that period, or nominate the townhouse as his main residence for that period. If he chooses to treat Anna's flat as his main residence, a part of any capital gain Mark makes when he sells the townhouse will be taxable. He will not get an exemption for the townhouse for the period that he nominated Anna's flat as his main residence (that is, 5\u00a0February 1999 to 11\u00a0March 2000). If Mark nominates the townhouse as his main residence, he qualifies for a full exemption on any capital gain he makes when it is sold because he owns 50% or less of it. However, because Mark and Anna had different main residences as a result of Mark's choice, and Anna owned more than 50% of the flat, her gain on the flat will only qualify for a 50% exemption for the period from 5\u00a0February 1999 to 11\u00a0March 2000. Anna's capital gain on the townhouse for the period 5\u00a0February 1999 to 11\u00a0March 2000 is taxable.

Menu Search Moving to a new main residence Find out when the exemption starts for your new home and ends for your old home. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download Moving in Your main residence is generally exempt from capital gains tax (CGT). For CGT purposes, your home qualifies for the main residence exemption from the time you acquire it, provided you move in as soon as practicable. If you buy your home, the 'time you acquire it' is the settlement date of the contract. If: there is a delay moving in because of illness or other unforeseen circumstances \u2013 your home is still exempt, provided you move in as soon as the cause of the delay is removed (for example, when you recover from the illness) you cannot move in because the property is being rented to someone \u2013 the property does not become your main residence until you move in you have not yet sold your old home \u2013 you can treat both homes as your main residence for up to 6\u00a0months. Example: moving in as soon as practicable Li Jing signed a contract to buy a townhouse in March. She took possession when settlement occurred in April. In late March, Li Jing's employer sent her overseas on an assignment for 4\u00a0months. She moved into the townhouse when she returned in late July. Li Jing's overseas assignment was unforeseen at the time she bought the townhouse. She moved in as soon as practicable after settlement of the contract. Therefore, she can treat the townhouse as her main residence from the date she acquired it. If Li Jing treats the townhouse as her main residence for this period, she cannot treat any other property as her main residence (except for a limited time if she is moving house). End of example Moving to another main residence If you acquire a new home before you dispose of your old one, you can treat both as your main residence for up to 6\u00a0months. You can do this if all of the following are true: you lived in your old home as your main residence for a continuous period of at least 3\u00a0months in the 12\u00a0months before you disposed of it you did not use your old home to produce income (such as rent) in any part of that 12\u00a0months when it was not your main residence the new property becomes your main residence. Example: full exemption for both homes Jill and Norman bought their new home under a contract that settled in January and they moved in immediately. They sold their old home under a contract that settled in April. Both the old and new homes are treated as their main residence for the period January to April, even though they did not live in the old home during that period. End of example Exceeding the 6-month limit If it takes longer than 6\u00a0months to dispose of your old home, the main residence exemption applies to both homes only for the last 6\u00a0months before you dispose of your old home. For the period before this, when you owned both homes, you can choose which home to treat as your main residence. The other will be subject to CGT for that period. Example: partial main residence exemption for one home Jeneen and John bought their old home under a contract that settled on 1\u00a0January 1999 and moved in immediately. It was their main residence until they bought another home, under a contract that settled on 1\u00a0January 2022. They retained their old home after moving into the new one. They did not use the old home to produce income. They sold the old home under a contract that settled on 1\u00a0October 2022. Jeneen and John owned this home for a total of 8,675\u00a0days.

Menu Search Investments in shares and units Last updated 9 July 2023 Print or Download Explains your CGT obligations if you sold or disposed of any shares or units in a unit trust in the 2022\u201323 income year. Managed fund A managed fund is a unit trust. Where we refer to a unit trust in this guide we are also referring to a managed fund. How capital gains tax affects shares and units For CGT purposes, shares in a company or units in a unit trust are treated in the same way as any other assets. As a general rule, if you acquired any shares or units on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, you may have to pay tax on any capital gain you make when a CGT event happens to them. This would usually be when you sell or otherwise dispose of them. It also includes where you redeem units in a managed fund by switching them from one fund to another. In these cases, CGT event A1 happens. There is a list of all CGT events at Appendix\u00a01 . Profits on the sale of shares held in carrying on a business of share trading are included as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, if the TOFA rules apply to you and you have elected to have certain tax-timing methods apply, gains and losses from trading of shares and units will be brought to account under those rules rather than as capital gains or capital losses. Capital gains or losses made in respect of certain CGT events happening to shares held by an Australian resident company that represents a non-portfolio interest in foreign companies may be reduced under Subdivision\u00a0768-G of ITAA 1997 depending on the active foreign business asset percentage of the foreign company, see Foreign income return form guide . A CGT event might happen to shares even if a change in their ownership is involuntary, for example, if the company in which you hold shares is taken over or merges with another company. This may result in a capital gain or capital loss. This section also deals with the receipt of non-assessable payments from a company (CGT event G1) while Trust distributions deals with non-assessable payments from a trust (CGT event E4 or E10). If you own shares in a company that has been placed in liquidation or administration, CGT event G3 lets you choose to make a capital loss when the liquidator or administrator declares the shares (or other financial instruments) worthless. There are a number of special CGT rules if you receive such things as bonus shares, bonus units, rights, options or non-assessable payments from a company or trust. Special rules also apply if you buy convertible notes or participate in an employee share scheme or a dividend reinvestment plan. The rest of this section explains these rules and has examples showing how they work in practice. The flowcharts at Appendix\u00a03 will also help you work out whether the special rules apply to you. For more information, see: Share investing versus share trading You and your shares 2023 Identifying shares or units sold Sometimes taxpayers own shares or units that they may have acquired at different times. This can happen as people decide to increase their investment in a particular company or unit trust. A common question people ask when they dispose of only part of their investment is how to identify the particular shares or units they have disposed of. This can be very important because shares or units bought at different times may have different amounts included in their cost base. In calculating the capital gain or capital loss when disposing of only part of an investment, you need to be able to identify which shares or units you have disposed of. Also, when you dispose of any shares or units you acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985, any capital gain or capital loss you make is generally disregarded. If you have the relevant records (for example, share certificates), you may be able to identify which particular shares or units you have disposed of. In other cases, the Commissioner will accept your selection of the identity of shares disposed of. Alternatively, you may wish to use a \u2018first in, first out\u2019 basis where you treat the first shares or units you bought as being the first you disposed of.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4611, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3b16425-46c9-458b-884b-395e178b1caf": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3b16425-46c9-458b-884b-395e178b1caf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7fc83606-e1ea-4ed0-a694-2cc10512cff0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "cbb37af8ffb7216a918389c1b9c9b566c82740f7f1daff628b835a60576dc9d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd561c34-cc11-47e2-a8fa-f7208f7fe7cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "b6af114e30b96806bcd330ef3ba5f2266a8b79c408e65a31b2b6d051a7202f21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c793009f-e60b-41e0-9cd0-e432fc435e47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fee59337d8756fb3bc00d455017e337a74e86dfa1920075bfc878471f40e6bbf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5f0c4dff6daf7f2bb8a6157fb855d9f52135d2bc2673e77783d7d042efb801e6", "text": "This can be very important because shares or units bought at different times may have different amounts included in their cost base.

In limited circumstances, we will also accept an average cost method to determine the cost of the shares disposed of. You can only use this average cost method when: the shares are in the same company the shares are acquired on the same day the shares have identical rights and obligations, and you are not required to use market value for cost base purposes. Example 22: Identifying when shares or units were acquired Boris bought 1,000\u00a0shares in WOA Ltd on 1\u00a0July 1997. He bought another 3,000\u00a0shares in the company on 1\u00a0July 2002. In December 2002, WOA Ltd issued Boris with a CHESS statement for his 4,000 shares. When he sold 1,500 of the shares on 1\u00a0January 2023, he was not sure whether they were the shares he bought in 2002 or whether they included the shares bought in 1997. Because Boris could not identify when he bought the particular shares he sold, he decided to use the \u2018first in, first out\u2019 method and nominated the 1,000 shares bought in 1997 plus 500 of the shares bought in 2002. End of example Demutualisation of life insurance and general insurance companies If you hold a policy in a life insurance company or a general insurance company that demutualises, you may be subject to CGT. This may be either at the time of the demutualisation or when you sell your shares (or another CGT event happens). A company demutualises when it changes its membership interests to shares, for example, AMP, IOOF and NRMA. (There are similar rules for non-insurance organisations that demutualise). The insurance company may give you the choice to either keep your share entitlement or to take cash by selling the shares under contract through an entity set up by the company (\u2018share sale facility\u2019). If it is an Australian insurance company and you chose to keep the shares, you will not be subject to CGT until you eventually sell them or another CGT event happens. However, if you elect to sell your share entitlement through a share sale facility and take cash, you need to include any capital gain in your tax return in the income year in which you entered into the contract to sell the shares, even though you may not receive the cash until a later income year. The demutualising company will write to all potential \u2018shareholders' and advise them of the acquisition cost in each instance, sometimes referred to as the \u2018embedded value'. Even though you did not pay anything to acquire the shares, they have a value that is used as the cost base and reduced cost base for CGT purposes. If you sell your shares before the insurance company is listed on the stock exchange and you make a capital loss, you disregard the loss. If you hold a policy in an overseas insurance company that demutualises, you may be subject to CGT at the time of the demutualisation. Contact us for advice if this applies to you. Demutualisation of private health insurers If you hold or held a policy of a private health insurer that converts from a not for profit insurer to a profit insurer by demutualising, you disregard capital gains and losses you make from a CGT event happening to your interest or other right you have or had in the insurer. If you receive shares or rights to acquire shares as a result of the demutualisation of your private health insurer you will be taken for CGT purposes to have acquired each share or right at the time it is issued. The first element of the cost base or reduced cost base is equal to the market value of that share or right on the day they are issued.", "start_char_idx": 3752, "end_char_idx": 8098, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c793009f-e60b-41e0-9cd0-e432fc435e47": {"__data__": {"id_": "c793009f-e60b-41e0-9cd0-e432fc435e47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7fc83606-e1ea-4ed0-a694-2cc10512cff0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "cbb37af8ffb7216a918389c1b9c9b566c82740f7f1daff628b835a60576dc9d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3b16425-46c9-458b-884b-395e178b1caf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "5f0c4dff6daf7f2bb8a6157fb855d9f52135d2bc2673e77783d7d042efb801e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "19f863d2-40bd-4596-92f4-6bcaa9f45819", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2c7298a714e5e0bcbb2e66243330df3740d89f20017491c4ef0d6836f0d1711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fee59337d8756fb3bc00d455017e337a74e86dfa1920075bfc878471f40e6bbf", "text": "If you hold a policy in an overseas insurance company that demutualises, you may be subject to CGT at the time of the demutualisation.

This includes when the shares are sold through the sale facility. If you receive a cash payment under the demutualisation that is not as a result of the sale of the shares or rights you will not make a capital gain or loss. Demutualisation of friendly societies If you hold or held a policy of a friendly society that demutualised from a not-for-profit friendly society to a profit friendly society, you may be able to disregard your capital gain or loss from the CGT event. You can disregard capital gains and losses you make from a CGT event happening to your interest or other right you have or had in the friendly society except where you receive an amount of money. Your friendly society should advise you whether you realised a capital gain or capital loss. If you received only shares, or rights to acquire shares, as a result of the demutualisation of your friendly society, we consider for CGT purposes that you acquired each share or right at the time it was issued. Your friendly society should advise you of the cost base of the shares or rights to acquire shares. The cost base, or reduced cost base, will be a proportion of the total of the: market value of the health insurance business and embedded value of the life insurance business and any other business of the friendly society. Selling the shares or rights (through the sale facility or otherwise) will be a CGT event that may give rise to a capital gain or capital loss in the income year in which you enter into the contract of sale. Share buy-backs As a shareholder, you may have received an offer from a company to buy back some or all of your shares in the company. If you disposed of shares back to the company under a share buy-back arrangement, you may have made a capital gain or capital loss from that CGT event. You compare the capital proceeds with your cost base and reduced cost base to work out whether you have made a capital gain or capital loss. The time you make the capital gain or capital loss will depend on the conditions of the particular buy-back offer. It may be the time you lodge your application to participate in the buy-back or, if it is a conditional offer of buy-back, the time you accept the offer. The capital proceeds are taken to be the market value the share would have been if the buy-back hadn\u2019t occurred and was never proposed, minus the amount of any dividend paid under the buy-back if shares in a company: are not bought back by the company in the ordinary course of business of a stock exchange, for example, the company writes to shareholders offering to buy their shares (commonly referred to as \u2018off-market share buy-back\u2019) and the buy-back price is less than what the market value of the share would have been if the buy-back hadn\u2019t occurred and was never proposed. In this situation, the company may provide you with that market value or, if the company obtained a class ruling from us, you can find out the amount at Events affecting shareholders (before 2013) or in the prior year tax instruction publications (2013 and later). Under other off-market buy-backs where a dividend is paid as part of the buy-back, the amount paid excluding the dividend is your capital proceeds for the share. Example 23: Buy-back Sam bought 4,500 shares in Company\u00a0A in January 1995 at a cost of $5 per share. In February 2023, Sam applied to participate in a buy-back offer to dispose of 675 shares (15%).

He takes $900 ($1,800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050%) into account in working out his net capital gain for the year. End of example Example 24: Off-market buy-back including dividend Ranjini bought 10,000 shares in Company\u00a0M in January 2004 at a cost of $6 per share, including brokerage. In January 2023, the company wrote to its shareholders advising them it was offering to buy back 10% of their shares for $9.60 each. The buy-back price was to include a franked dividend of $1.40 per share (and each dividend was to carry a franking credit of $0.60). Ranjini applied to participate in the buy-back to sell 1,000 of her shares. Company\u00a0M approved the buy-back on 1\u00a0May 2023 on the terms anticipated in its earlier letter to shareholders. The market value of Company\u00a0M shares at the time of the buy-back (if the buy-back did not occur and was never proposed) was $10.20. Ranjini received a cheque for $9,600 (1,000 shares \u00d7 $9.60) on 8\u00a0June 2023. Because it was an off-market share buy-back and the buy-back price was less than what the market value of the share would have been if the buy-back hadn\u2019t occurred, Ranjini works out her capital gain for the 2022\u201323 year as follows. Capital proceeds: Market value ($10.20) less dividend ($1.40) = $8.80 $8.80 \u00d7 1,000 shares = $8,800 Cost base: $6 \u00d7 1,000 shares = $6,000 Capital gain (before applying any discount) = $2,800 Ranjini takes her capital gain into account when completing question 18 in her supplementary tax return. She also includes her dividend at question 11 in her tax return ($1,400 at label T and $600 at label U ). End of example Shares in a company in liquidation or administration If a company is placed in liquidation or administration, company law restricts the transfer of shares in the company. This means that, in the absence of special CGT rules, you may not be able to realise a capital loss on shares that have become worthless unless you declare a trust over them. In certain circumstances, you can choose to realise a capital loss on worthless shares before dissolution (if you acquired the shares on or after 20\u00a0September 1985). This applies if you own shares in a company and a liquidator or administrator declares in writing that there is no likelihood you will receive any further distribution in the course of winding up the company.

End of example If no declaration is made by a liquidator or administrator, or you have not chosen to make a capital loss following a declaration by a liquidator or administrator, you may make a capital loss on your shares or financial instruments when a court order is given to dissolve the company.

Also, if a company is wound up voluntarily, shareholders may realise a capital loss either 3 months after a liquidator lodges a tax return showing that the final meeting of the company has been held, or on another date declared by a court.

In certain circumstances, if you acquire new shares in the takeover or merged company, you may be able to defer paying CGT until a later CGT event happens. Some takeover or merger arrangements involve an exchange of shares. In these cases, when you calculate your capital gain or capital loss, your capital proceeds will be the market value of the shares received in the takeover or merged company at the time of disposal of your original shares. If you receive a combination of money and shares in the takeover or merged company, your capital proceeds are the total of the money and the market value of the shares you received at the time of disposal of the original shares. The cost of acquiring the shares in the takeover or merged company is the market value of your original shares at the time you acquire the other shares, reduced by any cash proceeds. To correctly calculate the capital gain or capital loss for your original shares, you will need to keep records (in addition to the usual records) showing the parties to the arrangement, the conditions of the arrangement and the capital proceeds. As each takeover or merger arrangement will vary according to its own particular circumstances, you need to get full details of the arrangement from the parties involved. We are assuming in the following example that the scrip for scrip rollover does not apply. Example 26: Takeover In October 2000, Desiree bought 500 shares in DEF Ltd. These shares are currently worth $2 each. Their cost base is $1.50. XYZ Ltd offers to acquire each share in DEF Ltd for one share in XYZ Ltd and 75\u00a0cents cash. The shares in XYZ Ltd are valued at $1.25 each. Accepting the offer, Desiree receives 500 shares in XYZ Ltd and $375 cash. The capital proceeds received for each share in DEF Ltd is $2 ($1.25 market value of each XYZ Ltd share plus 75\u00a0cents cash). Therefore, as the cost base of each DEF Ltd share is $1.50, Desiree will make a capital gain of 50\u00a0cents ($2 \u2212 $1.50) on each share, a total of $250. The cost base of the newly acquired XYZ Ltd shares is the market value of the shares in DEF Ltd ($2) less the cash amount received ($0.75) which equals $1.25 each or a total of $625 (500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0$1.25). End of example Scrip for scrip rollover If a company in which you owned shares was taken over and you received new shares in the takeover company, you may be entitled to a scrip for scrip rollover. You may also be eligible for this rollover if you exchange a unit or other interest in a fixed trust, for a similar interest in another fixed trust. A scrip for scrip rollover is not available if a share is exchanged for a unit or other interest in a fixed trust, or if a unit or other interest in a fixed trust is exchanged for a share. You can only choose the rollover if you have made a capital gain from such an exchange on or after 10\u00a0December 1999. A rollover does not apply to a capital loss. A rollover is only available if the exchange is in consequence of an arrangement that results in the acquiring entity (or the wholly owned group of which it is a member) becoming the owner of 80% or more of the original company or trust.

For trusts, an arrangement may qualify if: all owners of trust voting interests in the original entity or, where there are no voting interests, all owners of units or other fixed interests can participate, or it includes a takeover bid that does not contravene the Corporations Act. There are special rules if a company or trust has a small number of shareholders or beneficiaries and there is a significant or common stakeholder. If the company or trust does not let you know, you will need to seek information from them about whether these conditions have been satisfied. The rollover allows you to disregard the capital gain made from the original shares, units or other interest. You are taken to have acquired the replacement shares, units or other interest for the cost base of the original interest. You can apply the CGT discount when you dispose of new shares providing the combined period that you owned the original shares and the new shares is at least 12\u00a0months. The same applies to units in a trust. Note that you have to deduct any capital losses (including unapplied net capital losses from earlier years) from your capital gains before applying the CGT discount. You may only be eligible for a partial rollover if you exchange shares, units or interests for similar interests in another entity (replacement interest) plus something else, usually cash. This is because the rollover applies only to the replacement interest. You will need to apportion the cost base of the original interest between the replacement interest and the cash (or other proceeds not eligible for the rollover). If your original shares, units or other interests were acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 (pre-CGT), you are not eligible for a scrip for scrip rollover. Instead, you acquire the replacement interest at the time of the exchange and the replacement interest is no longer a pre-CGT asset. However, if the arrangement is one that would otherwise qualify for a scrip for scrip rollover, the cost base of the replacement interest is its market value just after the acquisition. Example 27: Partial scrip for scrip rollover Gunther owns 100 shares in Windsor Ltd, each with a cost base of $9. He accepts a takeover offer from Regal Ltd, which provides for Gunther to receive one Regal share plus $10 cash for each share in Windsor. Gunther receives 100 shares in Regal and $1,000 cash. Just after Gunther is issued shares in Regal, each share is worth $20. Gunther receives $10 cash for each of his Windsor shares and so has $1,000 to which a rollover does not apply. In this case, it is reasonable to allocate a portion of the cost base of the original shares having regard to the proportion that the cash bears to the total proceeds. That is: A \u00f7 B \u00d7 C = D Where: A is cash B is total proceeds (cash and value of shares received) C is cost base of original share D is proportion of cost base for which cash was received Following on from the formula above, Gunther's calculations are: $1,000 \u00f7 $3,000 \u00d7 $900 = $300 Gunther\u2019s capital gain is as follows: $1,000 (cash) \u2212 $300 (cost base) = $700 (capital gain) Gunther calculates the cost base of each of his Regal shares as follows: ($900 \u2212 $300) \u00f7 100 = $6 End of example Example 28: Scrip for scrip rollover Stephanie owns ordinary shares in Reef Ltd. On 28\u00a0February 2023, she accepted a takeover offer from Starfish Ltd, under which she received one ordinary share and one preference share for each Reef share.

Under a demerger, the owners of the head entity of the group (that is, the shareholders of the company or unit holders of the trust) acquire a direct interest (shares or units) in an entity that was formerly part of the group (the demerged entity). Example 29: Demerger Peter owns shares (his original interest) in Company\u00a0A. Company\u00a0B is a wholly owned subsidiary of Company\u00a0A. Company A undertakes a demerger by transferring all its shares in Company\u00a0B to its shareholders. Following the demerger, all the shareholders in Company\u00a0A, including Peter, will own all the shares in Company\u00a0B (their new interests) in the same proportion that they hold their shares in Company\u00a0A. End of example Demergers on or after 1 July 2002 Certain rules apply to eligible demergers that happened on or after 1\u00a0July 2002. Demerger rollover If you received new interests in a demerged entity under an eligible demerger that happened on or after 1\u00a0July 2002, you need to be aware of the following CGT consequences: you may be entitled to choose a rollover for any capital gain or capital loss you make under the demerger you must calculate the cost base and reduced cost base of your interests in the head entity and your new interests in the demerged entity immediately after the demerger. The head entity will normally advise you whether it has undertaken an eligible demerger. We may have provided advice to the head entity in the form of a class ruling. Rollover available To choose a rollover, the demerger must be an eligible demerger. If you choose a rollover: you disregard any capital gain or capital loss made under the demerger, and your new interests in the demerged entity are acquired on the date of the demerger. However, if a proportion of your original interests was acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 (pre-CGT), the same proportion of your new interests in the demerged entity is treated as pre-CGT assets. If you do not choose a rollover: you cannot disregard any capital gain or capital loss made under the demerger, and all your new interests in the demerged entity are acquired on the date of the demerger. Demerger exemption This exemption applies to disregard certain capital gains or capital losses made by a demerging entity in a demerger group. A demerger group comprises the head entity of a group of companies or trusts and at least one demerger subsidiary. Discretionary trusts and superannuation funds cannot be members of a demerger group. Cost base calculations You must recalculate the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of your remaining original interests in the head entity and of your new interests in the demerged entity. You must make these calculations whether you choose a rollover or not, or if no CGT event happens to your original interests under the demerger. The calculation will depend on whether you have pre-CGT original interests in the head entity.

You must make these calculations whether you choose a rollover or not, or if no CGT event happens to your original interests under the demerger. The calculation will depend on whether you have pre-CGT original interests in the head entity. Cost base calculations where you do not have pre-CGT interests You work out the cost base and reduced cost base of your remaining post-CGT original interests and your post-CGT new interests immediately after the demerger. You do this by spreading the total cost base of your post-CGT original interests (immediately before the demerger) over both your remaining post-CGT original interests and your post-CGT new interests. The following steps explain how to do this. The steps and example\u00a030 work out new cost bases using a method referred to as the \u2018relative market value method\u2019, which is sometimes also referred to as the \u2018averaging method\u2019. You may be able to use other methods if they are reasonable. For more information, see Demergers CGT rollover for shareholders and unit holders . Step 1 Add the cost bases of your post-CGT original interests immediately before the demerger. Do not reduce your total cost base by any capital amounts returned to you under the demerger and do not include indexation. Step 2 Use the relevant percentages to apportion the step\u00a01 amount between: your post-CGT original interests in the head entity, and your post-CGT new interests in the demerged entity. The head entity should generally advise you of the relevant percentages to use. Step 3 Divide the cost base apportioned to the head entity interests (from step\u00a02) by the number of remaining post-CGT original interests you own. Step 4 Divide the cost base apportioned to the demerged entity interests (from step\u00a02) by the number of post-CGT new interests you own. These amounts will form the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of your post-CGT original interests and post-CGT new interests. Example 30: No pre-CGT interests Under the BHP Billiton Ltd demerger of BHP Steel Ltd, shareholders received one BHP Steel share for every 5\u00a0BHP Billiton shares they owned at the date of the demerger. Anita owned 280\u00a0BHP Billiton shares (all post-CGT) with a cost base of $2,500 immediately before the demerger. Under the demerger, Anita received 56\u00a0BHP Steel shares. Anita works out the cost base and reduced cost base of her BHP Billiton shares and BHP Steel shares as follows: Step\u00a01 The total cost base of the BHP Billiton shares immediately before the demerger was $2,500. Step\u00a02 BHP Billiton advised shareholders to apportion 94.937% of the total cost base from step\u00a01 to BHP Billiton shares and 5.063% to BHP Steel shares: (a) BHP Billiton: 94.937% \u00d7 $2,500= $2,373.43 (b) BHP Steel: 5.063% \u00d7 $2,500 = $126.58 Step\u00a03 Divide the step 2(a) amount by the 280 BHP Billiton shares: $2,373.43 \u00f7 280 = $8.48 per share Step\u00a04 Divide the step 2(b) amount by the 56 BHP Steel shares $126.58 \u00f7 56 = $2.26 per share End of example Cost base calculations where you have pre-CGT interests If you choose a rollover If you choose a rollover and a proportion of your original interests are pre-CGT, the same proportion of your new interests will be treated as pre-CGT interests. It is not necessary to calculate the cost base and reduced cost base for your pre-CGT interests.

Example 31: With pre-CGT interests Anita owned 400 BHP Billiton shares immediately before the demerger: 120 pre-CGT shares 280 post-CGT shares (the cost base of which, immediately before the demerger, was $2,500). Either Anita chooses a rollover. The 24 BHP Steel shares she received for the 120 pre-CGT BHP Billiton shares are pre-CGT. It is not necessary for Anita to work out the cost base and reduced cost base for her pre-CGT interests. Immediately after the demerger, she calculates the cost base and reduced cost base of her 280 post-CGT BHP Billiton shares and the 56 BHP Steel shares she received for those BHP Billiton shares in the same way as shown in example\u00a030 . Or Anita does not choose a rollover. The 24 BHP Steel shares she received for the 120 pre-CGT BHP shares are post-CGT shares acquired on the date of the demerger. Immediately after the demerger, the cost base and reduced cost base of the 24 BHP Steel shares are $3.45 per share (the capital return of $0.69 per share\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05). Immediately after the demerger, she calculates the cost base and reduced cost base of her 280 post-CGT BHP Billiton shares and the 56 BHP Steel shares she received for those BHP Billiton shares in the same way as shown in example\u00a030 . In either case there is no change to the pre-CGT status of Anita\u2019s 120 BHP Billiton shares. End of example Using the discount method if you sell your shares after the demerger If you sell your new interests in the demerged entity after the demerger, you must have owned those interests for at least 12\u00a0months from the date you acquired the corresponding original interests in the head entity in order to use the discount method. Example 32: Using the discount method after a demerger (1) You received BHP Steel Ltd shares under the demerger on 22\u00a0July 2002. They related to shares you acquired in BHP Billiton Ltd on 15\u00a0August 2001. You can only use the discount method to work out your capital gain on these shares if you dispose of them after 15\u00a0August 2002; that is, more than 12\u00a0months after the date you acquired the BHP Billiton shares. End of example However, you calculate the 12\u00a0months from the date of demerger if you: did not choose the rollover and you received new interests in the demerged entity which relate to pre-CGT interests in the head entity, or acquired your new interests without a CGT event happening to your original interests. Example 33: Using the discount method after a demerger (2) You received BHP Steel Ltd shares under the demerger where you calculated the cost base as $3.45 per share (because they related to pre-CGT shares you owned in BHP Billiton Ltd and you did not choose a rollover).", "start_char_idx": 32283, "end_char_idx": 36482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aaee2167-c7a3-43d0-a1b1-6a34240ce433": {"__data__": {"id_": "aaee2167-c7a3-43d0-a1b1-6a34240ce433", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7fc83606-e1ea-4ed0-a694-2cc10512cff0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "cbb37af8ffb7216a918389c1b9c9b566c82740f7f1daff628b835a60576dc9d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e361f94e-fc03-4ab1-856d-18592618435e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "9639c615f4f7595db56dcdaec7cecac13278aaff7e85db7e8ddd57c769e6456b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "adeca4a6-f7e3-4ba9-9397-facd9a8aa869", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d5826d9f7c729e8b0e9f25fbfd9a1fb9fb68de9f65c79cdabd5c0aa00f579ffa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3500c853aed00cc4d3c3221cf51152f859b190496f7621e9fd216687700eb043", "text": "You can only use the discount method to work out your capital gain on these shares if you dispose of them after 15\u00a0August 2002; that is, more than 12\u00a0months after the date you acquired the BHP Billiton shares.

Dividend reinvestment plans Some companies ask their shareholders whether they would like to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan. Under these plans, shareholders can choose to use their dividend to acquire additional shares in the company instead of receiving a cash payment. These shares are usually issued at a discount on the current market price of the shares in the company. For CGT purposes, if you participate in a dividend reinvestment plan you are treated as if you had received a cash dividend and then used the cash to buy additional shares. Each share (or parcel of shares) acquired in this way, on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, is subject to CGT. The cost base of the new shares includes the price you paid to acquire them, that is, the amount of the dividend. Example 34: Dividend reinvestment plans Natalie owns 1,440 shares in PHB Ltd. The shares are currently worth $8 each. In November 2022, the company declared a dividend of 25\u00a0cents per share. Natalie could either take the $360 dividend as cash (1,440\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0cents) or receive 45 additional shares in the company (360\u00a0\u00f7\u00a08). Natalie decided to participate in the dividend reinvestment plan and received 45 new shares on 20\u00a0December 2022. She included the $360 dividend in her 2022\u201323 assessable income. For CGT purposes, she acquired the 45 new shares for $360 on 20\u00a0December 2022. End of example Bonus shares Bonus shares are additional shares a shareholder receives for an existing holding of shares in a company. If you dispose of bonus shares received on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, you may make a capital gain. You may also have to modify the cost base and reduced cost base of your existing shares in the company if you receive bonus shares. The cost base and reduced cost base of bonus shares depend on whether the bonus shares are assessable as a dividend. As a result of changes to company and taxation laws, the paid-up value of bonus shares is now generally not assessable as a dividend. An exception to this rule is where you have the choice of being paid a cash dividend or of being issued shares under a dividend reinvestment plan. These shares are treated as dividends and the amount of the dividend is included in your assessable income. Table 3 explains how the time of issue of your bonus shares affects whether the paid-up value of the bonus shares is assessed as a dividend. Date Implications of timing of bonus shares From 20\u00a0September 1985 to 30\u00a0June 1987 inclusive Many bonus shares issued were paid out of a company\u2019s asset revaluation reserve or from a share premium account. These bonus shares are not usually assessable dividends. From 1\u00a0July 1987 to 30\u00a0June 1998 inclusive The paid-up value of bonus shares issued is assessed as a dividend unless paid from a share premium account.

From 1\u00a0July 1998 The paid-up value of bonus shares issued is generally not assessed as a dividend unless you have the choice of being paid a dividend or being issued shares and you chose to be issued with shares. There are other, less common, circumstances where bonus shares will be assessed as a dividend, for example, where: the bonus shares are being substituted for a dividend to give a tax advantage the company directs bonus shares to some shareholders and dividends to others to give them a tax benefit. Flowchart 3.1 in appendix\u00a03 summarises the different rules applying to different bonus shares issued on or after 20\u00a0September 1985. Bonus shares issued where no amount is assessed as a dividend Original shares acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 If your bonus shares relate to other shares that you acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 (referred to as your original shares) your bonus shares are taken to have been acquired on the date you acquired your original shares. If you acquired your original shares at different times, you will have to work out how many of your bonus shares are taken to have been acquired at each of those times. Calculate the cost base and reduced cost base of the bonus shares by apportioning the cost base and reduced cost base of the original shares over both the original and the bonus shares. Effectively, this results in a reduction of the cost base and reduced cost base of the original shares. You also include any calls paid on partly paid bonus shares as part of the cost base and reduced cost base that is apportioned between the original and the bonus shares. Original shares acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 Your CGT obligations depend on when the bonus shares were issued and whether they are fully paid or partly paid. For more information, see Flowchart 3.1 in Appendix\u00a03 . Example 35: Fully paid bonus shares Chris bought 100 shares in MAC Ltd for $1 each on 1\u00a0June 1985. He bought 300 more shares for $1 each on 27\u00a0May 1986. On 15\u00a0November 1986, MAC Ltd issued Chris with 400 bonus shares from its capital profits reserve, fully paid to $1. Chris did not pay anything to acquire the bonus shares and no part of the value of the bonus shares was assessed as a dividend. For CGT purposes, the acquisition date of 100 of the bonus shares is 1\u00a0June 1985 (pre-CGT). Therefore, those bonus shares are not subject to CGT. The acquisition date of the other 300 bonus shares is 27\u00a0May 1986. Their cost base is worked out by spreading the cost of the 300 shares Chris bought on that date over both those original shares and the remaining 300 bonus shares. As the 300 original shares cost $300, the cost base of each share will now be 50\u00a0cents. End of example Example 36: Partly paid bonus shares Klaus owns 200 shares in MAC Ltd, which he bought on 31\u00a0October 1984, and 200 shares in PUP Ltd, which he bought on 31\u00a0January 1985. On 1\u00a0January 1987, both MAC Ltd and PUP Ltd made their shareholders a one-for-one bonus share offer of $1 shares partly paid to 50\u00a0cents. Klaus elected to accept the offer and acquired 200 new partly paid shares in each company. No part of the value of the bonus shares was taxed as a dividend. On 1\u00a0April 1989, PUP Ltd made a call for the balance of 50\u00a0cents outstanding on the partly paid shares, payable on 30\u00a0June 1989. Klaus paid the call payment on that date.

On 1\u00a0April 1989, PUP Ltd made a call for the balance of 50\u00a0cents outstanding on the partly paid shares, payable on 30\u00a0June 1989. Klaus paid the call payment on that date. MAC Ltd has not yet made any calls on its partly paid shares. For CGT purposes, Klaus is treated as having acquired his bonus PUP Ltd shares on the date he became liable to pay the call (1\u00a0April 1989). The cost base of the bonus shares in PUP Ltd includes the amount of the call payment (50\u00a0cents) plus the market value of the shares immediately before the call was made. The MAC Ltd bonus shares will continue to have the same acquisition date as the original shares (31\u00a0October 1984) and are therefore not subject to CGT. However, this will not be the case if Klaus makes any more payments to the company on calls made by the company for any part of the unpaid amount on the bonus shares. In this case, the acquisition date of the bonus shares will be when the liability to pay the call arises and the bonus shares will then be subject to CGT. End of example Bonus shares issued where the paid-up value is assessed as a dividend If the paid-up value of bonus shares is assessed as a dividend, you may have to pay CGT when you dispose of the bonus shares, regardless of when you acquired the original shares. Original shares acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 If your bonus shares relate to original shares that you acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, the acquisition date of the bonus shares is the date they were issued. Their cost base and reduced cost base includes the amount of the dividend, plus any call payments you made to the company if they were only partly paid. Exception \u2013 bonus shares received before 1\u00a0July 1987 The exception to this rule is bonus shares you received before 1\u00a0July 1987. They are taken to be acquired on the date you acquired your original shares. Their cost base is calculated as if the amount was not taxed as a dividend. For more information, see Bonus shares issued where no amount is assessed as a dividend . Original shares acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 The rules that apply where you acquired your original shares before 20\u00a0September 1985 depend on when the bonus shares were issued and whether they were partly paid or fully paid. For more information, see Flowchart 3.1 in Appendix\u00a03 . Example 37: Cost base of bonus shares Mark owns 1,000 shares in RIM Ltd, which he bought on 30\u00a0September 1984 for $1 each. On 1\u00a0February 1997, the company issued him with 500 bonus shares partly paid to 50\u00a0cents. The paid-up value of bonus shares ($250) is an assessable dividend to Mark. On 1\u00a0May 1997, the company made a call for the 50\u00a0cents outstanding on each bonus share, which Mark paid on 1\u00a0July 1997. The total cost base of the bonus shares is $500, consisting of the $250 dividend received on the issue of the bonus shares on 1\u00a0February 1997 plus the $250 call payment made on 1\u00a0July 1997. The bonus shares were acquired on 1\u00a0February 1997. If Mark held the bonus shares for more than 12\u00a0months when he sold them, he can use the indexation method to calculate his capital gain.

The bonus shares were acquired on 1\u00a0February 1997. If Mark held the bonus shares for more than 12\u00a0months when he sold them, he can use the indexation method to calculate his capital gain. Amounts payable to a company on shares in the company can be indexed only from the date of actual payment. In Mark\u2019s case, he can only index the $250 call payment from the date he paid it (1\u00a0July 1997). However, indexation on the $250 dividend included in his assessable income on the issue of the bonus shares was available from 1\u00a0February 1997. This is different from the indexation treatment of amounts paid to acquire assets in other circumstances where indexation is available from the time the liability to make the payment arises. The indexation rules are explained in more detail in How to work out your capital gain or capital loss . If Mark disposes of the shares after 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999, he can calculate his capital gain using either the indexation method or the discount method. End of example Bonus units If you have received bonus units on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, you may make a capital gain when you dispose of them. The CGT rules for bonus units are similar to those for bonus shares. However, the rules do not apply if the bonus units are issued by a corporate unit trust or a public trading trust. When the unit trust issues the bonus units, they will generally tell you what amount (if any) you have to include in your assessable income. You need to keep a record of that information to work out your CGT obligation when you dispose of them. Flowchart 3.2 in appendix\u00a03 summarises the rules applying to bonus units issued on or after 20\u00a0September 1985. Bonus units issued where no amount is included in assessable income Original units acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 If your bonus units relate to other units that you acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, your bonus units are taken to have been acquired on the date you acquired your original units. If you have original units that you acquired at different times, you will have to work out how many of your bonus units are taken to have been acquired at each of those times. Calculate the cost base and reduced cost base of the bonus units by apportioning the cost base and reduced cost base of the original units over the original units and the bonus units. Effectively, this results in a reduction of the cost base and reduced cost base of the original units. You also apportion any calls paid on partly paid bonus units between the cost bases (and reduced cost bases) of the original units and the bonus units. Original units acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 The rules that apply if you acquired your original units before 20\u00a0September 1985 depend on when the bonus units were issued and whether they were partly paid or fully paid. For more information, see Flowchart\u00a03.2 in Appendix 3 . Example 38: Unit trusts Sarah is a unit holder in the CPA Unit Trust. She bought 1,000 units on 1\u00a0September 1985 for $1 each and 1,000 units on 1\u00a0July 1996 for $2 each. On 1\u00a0March 1997, the unit trust made a one-for-one bonus unit issue to all unit holders. Sarah received 2,000 new units. She did not include any amount in her assessable income as a result. The 1,000 new units issued for the original units she acquired on 1\u00a0September 1985 are also treated as having been acquired on that date and are therefore not subject to CGT. However, the 1,000 new units issued for the original units she acquired on 1\u00a0July 1996 are subject to CGT. Their cost base is worked out by spreading the cost of the original units ($2,000) acquired on that date over both the original units and the bonus units. Each of the units therefore has a cost base of $1.

End of example Bonus units issued where an amount is included in assessable income If you include any amount in your assessable income as a result of the issue of bonus units, their acquisition date is the date they were issued, regardless of when you acquired the original units. The cost base and reduced cost base of the bonus units is the amount included in your assessable income as a result of the issue of those units, plus any calls you made if they were only partly paid. If the bonus units were issued before 20\u00a0September 1985, any capital gain or capital loss is disregarded, as they are pre-CGT assets. Rights or options to acquire shares or units If you own shares or units, the company or trust may issue you rights or options to acquire additional shares or units at a specified price. The market value of these rights, at the time the rights or options are issued to you, is non-assessable non-exempt income, provided: you already own shares or units the right was issued to you because of your ownership of the shares or units your shares or units, and the rights, must not be revenue assets or trading stock at the time they are issued those rights were not acquired under an employee share scheme your shares or units, and the rights, are not traditional securities, and your shares or units are not convertible interests. You will make a capital gain or capital loss when a CGT event happens to: the rights or options, other than as a result of exercising those rights or options the shares or units acquired as a result of exercising those rights or options. The calculation of the capital gain arising from a subsequent CGT event will not be affected by any non-assessable non-exempt income amount. Rights and options issued directly to you from a company or trust for no cost You are taken to have acquired the rights and options at the same time as you acquired the original shares or units. Therefore, if you acquired the original shares or units before 20\u00a0September 1985, you disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make when the rights or options expire or are sold, as they are pre-CGT assets. If you acquired the original shares or units on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, you make a capital gain if the capital proceeds on the sale or expiry of the rights or options are more than their cost base. You make a capital loss if the reduced cost base of the rights or options is more than those capital proceeds. Rights and options you paid to acquire from a company or trust, or that you acquired from another person If you acquired your rights or options on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, they are treated much like any other CGT asset and are subject to CGT. Flowchart 3.3 , Flowchart 3.4 and Flowchart 3.5 in appendix\u00a03 summarise the different rules applying to the treatment of rights or options to acquire shares or units. Exercising rights or options to acquire shares or units Many people decide to exercise their rights or options to acquire new shares or units rather than sell them. In most cases, no CGT is payable at the time you exercise the rights or options. The acquisition date of the shares or units is the date of exercise of the rights or options to acquire the shares or units. If you exercise the rights or options on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, some special rules apply for calculating the cost base and reduced cost base of shares or units acquired as a result. Exercising the option or right may be subject to the foreign resident capital gains withholding, regardless of when the option or right was originally acquired.

The first element of the cost base and reduced cost base for the shares or units you acquire on exercising your rights or options is: the amount you paid for the rights or options, plus the amount you paid for the shares or units on exercising the rights or options. Flowchart 3.5 in Appendix\u00a03 summarises the rules relating to the treatment of such options and rights. Example 39: Sale of rights Shanti owns 2,000 shares in ZAC Ltd. She bought 1,000 shares on 1\u00a0June 1985 and 1,000 shares on 1\u00a0December 1996. On 1\u00a0July 1998, ZAC Ltd granted each of its shareholders one right for each 4\u00a0shares owned to acquire shares in the company for $1.80 each. Shanti therefore received 500 rights in total. At that time, shares in ZAC Ltd were worth $2. Each right was therefore worth 20\u00a0cents. Shanti decided that she did not wish to buy any more shares in ZAC Ltd, so she sold all her rights for 20\u00a0cents each, a total amount of $100. Only those rights issued for the shares she bought on 1\u00a0December 1996 are subject to CGT. As Shanti did not pay anything for the rights, she has made a $50 taxable capital gain on their sale. The $50 Shanti received on the sale of her rights for the shares she bought on 1\u00a0June 1985 is not subject to CGT, as those rights are taken to have been acquired at the same time as the shares, that is, before 20\u00a0September 1985. End of example Example 40: Rights exercised Assume that, in example 39 , Shanti wished to acquire more shares in ZAC Ltd. She therefore exercised all 500 rights on 1\u00a0August 1998 when they were still worth 20\u00a0cents each. There are no CGT consequences arising from the exercise of the rights. However, the 500 shares Shanti acquired on 1\u00a0August 1998 when she exercised the rights are subject to CGT and are acquired at the time of the exercise. When Shanti exercised the rights issued for the shares she bought on 1\u00a0December 1996, the cost base of the 250 shares she acquired is the amount she paid to exercise each right ($1.80 for each share). When Shanti exercised the rights for the shares she bought before 20\u00a0September 1985, Shanti\u2019s cost base for each of the 250 shares she acquired includes not only the exercise price of the right ($1.80) but also the market value of the right at that time (20\u00a0cents). The cost base of each share is therefore $2. End of example CGT discount on shares or units acquired from exercise of rights or options You can use the discount method to calculate your capital gain from an asset only if you own it for at least 12\u00a0months. In calculating any capital gain on shares or units you acquire from the exercise of a right or option, the 12-month period applies from the date you acquire the shares or units (not the date you acquired the right or option).", "start_char_idx": 56341, "end_char_idx": 60327, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e70414b-7fb4-4a2a-b69f-d66e9293dce9": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e70414b-7fb4-4a2a-b69f-d66e9293dce9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7fc83606-e1ea-4ed0-a694-2cc10512cff0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "cbb37af8ffb7216a918389c1b9c9b566c82740f7f1daff628b835a60576dc9d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9e9e1d1-4a58-4e46-9b27-12ca9d33b870", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "44d93f00a42c06b7d7f898e7888e55157d97bc7fc9331ba2ba9cc2f969b0ec0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4697de1-17f2-4ced-ad2c-3c232a1fced5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "efdebaba795aa70a5cfe30fceecddbee38778ed3726d26852f55660304313419", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d8832997b2aec908e0f1640efbcf0f7a51c4b0457e753ca0c7ff356c78046726", "text": "When Shanti exercised the rights for the shares she bought before 20\u00a0September 1985, Shanti\u2019s cost base for each of the 250 shares she acquired includes not only the exercise price of the right ($1.80) but also the market value of the right at that time (20\u00a0cents).

Retail premiums Some or all of a payment may be a retail premium if you receive it because: you did not exercise some or all of your right or entitlement, either by choice or otherwise you were not eligible to exercise some or all of your right or entitlement, or you did not receive some or all of your right or entitlement. You receive a retail premium if: you own shares in a company which offers shareholders a right or entitlement to subscribe for additional shares in proportion to their existing shareholding at a set amount, often called 'the offer price' you do not participate; that is, one of the following applies you choose not to take up some or all of your right or entitlement you are ineligible to receive some or all of a right or entitlement you are not permitted to take up some or all of your right or entitlement the company that issued the right or entitlement arranges to issue a number of shares, equivalent to those which would have been issued to you had you exercised the right or entitlement for which you did not participate, to other subscribers such as institutional investors. The amount offered by the subscribers for the equivalent shares is often called 'the clearing price' the clearing price is the basis of a payment to you, generally because it is more than the offer price. The retail premium will be the amount paid to you, generally worked out on a pro rata basis by the company because you are a shareholder or unit holder and you do not participate. The retail premium the company pays will generally be a share of all or part of the difference between the clearing price of the shares and the offer price. Retail premiums are unfranked dividends, or alternatively ordinary income, and should not be treated as capital gains. Shareholders who receive the premiums are not eligible to claim the CGT discount. For more information, see Taxing retail premiums . Convertible notes A convertible note (which is one type of convertible interest) is another type of investment you can make in a company or unit trust. A convertible note earns interest on the amount you pay to acquire the note until the note\u2019s expiry date. On expiry of the note, you can either ask for the return of the money paid or convert the note to new shares or units. Convertible notes you acquired after 10\u00a0May 1989 will generally not be subject to CGT if you sold or disposed of them before they were converted into shares. Instead, you include any gain you make in your tax return as ordinary income and any loss you make is included as a deduction. If the TOFA rules apply to you, gains and losses from your convertible notes may be brought to account under those TOFA rules. For more information, see You and your shares 2023 . If you have sold or disposed of a convertible note that you acquired before 11\u00a0May 1989, contact us . When you phone, have the date you acquired the convertible note as this may affect the tax treatment. Conversion of notes to shares The tax treatment that applies when your convertible notes are converted to shares depends on: when you acquired the convertible notes the type of convertible note when the conversion occurred, and when the convertible note was issued. Shares acquired by the conversion of convertible notes on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 will be subject to CGT when they are sold or disposed of, as the shares are taken to be acquired when the conversion happens. You may have acquired the convertible notes on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 and, as a traditional security or qualifying security, you have already included the gain you made on the conversion of the notes in your tax return as income (or as a deduction if you made a loss). The way you calculate the cost base of the shares varies depending on whether the notes converted to shares before 1\u00a0July 2001 or on or after that date.

Example 41: Converting notes to shares David bought 1,000 convertible notes in DCS Ltd on 1\u00a0July 1997 (that is, notes that were issued before 15\u00a0May 2002). The notes cost $5 each. Each convertible note is convertible into one DCS Ltd share. On expiry of the notes on 1\u00a0July 2000, shares in the company were worth $7 each. David converted the notes to shares, which are subject to CGT. No further amount was payable on conversion of the notes. David sold the shares on 4\u00a0December 2022 for $10 each. The $2 ($7 \u2212 $5) gain David made on the conversion of each of the notes to shares was assessable to David as ordinary income at the time of conversion, that is, in 2000\u201301. As such, David has no capital gain in that year. The $3 ($10 \u2212 $7) gain David made on the sale of each of the shares is subject to CGT. The $7 cost base is the market value per share on the date the notes converted to shares. Because he sold the shares after 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999 and owned them for at least 12\u00a0months, David can claim the CGT discount. David calculates his capital gain as follows: $3 per share \u00d7 1,000 shares = $3,000 less CGT discount of 50% = $1,500 Net capital gain = $1,500 David includes the capital gain on his 2023 tax return. End of example Stapled securities Stapled securities are created when 2 or more different securities are legally bound together so that they cannot be sold separately. Many different types of securities can be stapled together. For example, many property trusts have their units stapled to the shares of companies with which they are closely associated. The effect of stapling depends on the specific terms of the stapling arrangement. The issuer of the stapled security will be able to provide you with detailed information on their particular stapling arrangement. However, in general, the effect of stapling is that each individual security retains its character and there is no variation to the rights or obligations attaching to the individual securities. Although a stapled security must be dealt with as a whole, the individual securities that are stapled are treated separately for tax purposes. For example, if a share in a company and a unit in a unit trust are stapled, you: continue to include separately in your tax return dividends from the company and trust distributions from the trust work out any capital gain or capital loss separately for the unit and the share.

The issuer of the stapled security will be able to provide you with detailed information on their particular stapling arrangement. However, in general, the effect of stapling is that each individual security retains its character and there is no variation to the rights or obligations attaching to the individual securities. Although a stapled security must be dealt with as a whole, the individual securities that are stapled are treated separately for tax purposes. For example, if a share in a company and a unit in a unit trust are stapled, you: continue to include separately in your tax return dividends from the company and trust distributions from the trust work out any capital gain or capital loss separately for the unit and the share. Because each security that makes up your stapled security is a separate CGT asset, you must work out a cost base and reduced cost base for each separately. If you acquired the securities after they were stapled (for example, you bought the stapled securities on the ASX), you do this by apportioning, on a reasonable basis, the amount you paid to acquire the stapled security (and any other relevant costs) between the various securities that are stapled. One reasonable basis of apportionment is to have regard to the portion of the value of the stapled security that each security represented. The issuer of the stapled security may provide assistance in determining these amounts. Example 42: Apportionment of cost base and reduced cost base to the separate securities On 1\u00a0September 2002, Cathy acquired 100 JKL stapled securities, which comprised a share in JKL Ltd and a unit in the JKL Unit Trust. She paid $4.00 for each stapled security, and on the basis of the information provided to her by the issuer of the stapled securities, she determined that 60% of the amount paid was attributable to the value of the share and 40% to the value of the unit. On this basis, the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of each of Cathy\u2019s shares in JKL Ltd will be $2.40 ($4.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060%). The first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of each of Cathy\u2019s units in JKL Unit Trust will be $1.60 ($4.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040%). End of example If you acquired your stapled securities as part of a corporate restructure you will, during the restructure, have owned individual securities that were not stapled. The way you work out the cost base and reduced cost base of each security depends on the terms of the stapling arrangement. The stapling does not result in any CGT consequences for you, because the individual securities are always treated as separate securities. However, there may be other aspects of the whole restructure arrangement which will result in CGT consequences for you. Example 43: CGT consequences associated with the stapling of securities Jamie acquired 100 units in the Westfield America Trust (WFA) in January 2003. Immediately before the merger of Westfield America Trust with Westfield Holdings Ltd and Westfield Trust (July 2004), the cost base of each of his units was $2.12 (total cost base = $212 ($2.12\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100)). Under the arrangement, Jamie\u2019s original units in WFA were firstly consolidated in the ratio of 0.15 consolidated WFA unit for each original WFA unit. After the consolidation, Jamie held 15 consolidated WFA units with a cost base of $14.13 ($212\u00a0\u00f7\u00a015) each. There were no CGT consequences for Jamie as a result of the consolidation of his units in WFA. Jamie then received a capital distribution of $1.01 for each consolidated unit he held. CGT event E4 happens as a result of the capital distribution, see Appendix\u00a01 . Consequently, Jamie must reduce the cost base of each of his consolidated WFA units by $1.01 to $13.12. The capital distribution was compulsorily applied to acquire a share in Westfield Holdings Ltd (WSF) for $0.01 and a unit in the Westfield Trust (WFT) for $1.00. The first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of each of Jamie\u2019s new shares in WSF will be $0.01 and, for each new WFT unit, $1.00. The units and shares were then stapled to form a Westfield Group Security.

Other tax provisions may apply upon disposal of some securities. For example, you include a gain made on a traditional security in your assessable income under other tax provisions. Example 44: Apportioning the capital proceeds between the separate securities On 1\u00a0August 1983, Kelley purchased 100 shares in XYZ Ltd for $4.00 per share. In August 2002, Kelley was allocated 100 units in XYZ Unit Trust under a corporate reorganisation of the XYZ Group. The units were acquired for $1.00 each, with the funds to acquire the units coming from a capital reduction made in respect of her shares. At that same time, Kelley\u2019s shares in XYZ Ltd and units in XYZ Unit Trust were stapled and became known as XYZ stapled securities. Kelley disposed of all of her XYZ stapled securities on 1\u00a0March 2023 for $8.00 per security. On the basis of the information provided by the issuer of the stapled securities, Kelley determined that of this amount, 70% or $5.60 per share ($8.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a070%) was attributable to the value of her XYZ Ltd shares, and 30% or $2.40 per unit ($8.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030%) was attributable to the value of her units in the XYZ Unit Trust. Kelley must account for the sale of each share and unit (that make up the stapled security) separately. As Kelley acquired her XYZ Ltd shares before 20\u00a0September 1985, she disregards any capital gain or capital loss she makes on the disposal of these shares. Kelley will make a capital gain of $1.40 per unit ($2.40 \u2212 $1.00) on the disposal of her units in the XYZ Unit Trust. As Kelley owned those units for more than 12\u00a0months, she can reduce her capital gain by the CGT discount of 50% after applying any capital losses. End of example Employee share schemes Employee share schemes (ESS) give employees benefits such as shares or the opportunity to buy shares or rights (including options) in the company they work for at a discounted price. These benefits are known as ESS interests. In most cases, ESS interests are exempt from CGT implications until the discount on the ESS interest has been taxed. When you sell your ESS interests (or resulting shares), they are taxed under the CGT rules (or if you are a share trader, the trading stock rules). CGT implications for employee shares and rights under a corporate restructure If employee shares or rights are exchanged for replacement shares or rights in a new company under a corporate restructure that happened on or after 1\u00a0July 2004, a rollover may be available so that there is no taxing point under the ESS tax rules. Corporate restructures affected include mergers, demergers (in limited circumstances) and 100% takeovers. Any capital gain or capital loss made on the employee shares or rights because of the restructure will be disregarded where this rollover applies.

Shares in an early stage innovation company Modified CGT treatment applies to your shares in an ESIC, depending on how long you hold the shares before a CGT event happens to them (such as the sale of the shares) and whether you make a capital gain or capital loss from the CGT event. However, if you invest more than $50,000 in ESICs in an income year and do not meet the sophisticated investor requirements, you will not be eligible for modified CGT treatment on any of the shares acquired in that income year. The general rules for modified CGT treatment are summarised below: Shares held for Modified CGT treatment Less than 12\u00a0months Any capital gain you make from a CGT event is not disregarded. You must disregard any capital loss you make from a CGT event that happens to the shares during this period. 12\u00a0months or more but less than 10\u00a0years A capital gain or capital loss that you made from a CGT event happening to the shares is disregarded. 10\u00a0years or more The first element of the cost base and reduced cost base for the share will become its market value on the tenth anniversary of the share being issued to you. This means that you will recognise any capital gains or losses that happen from this point in time. For more information, see: Qualifying as an early stage innovation company Tax incentives for early stage investors If a CGT roll-over applies Generally, special rules apply to preserve the modified CGT treatment for eligible shares in an ESIC that are subject to a CGT roll-over. However, the modified CGT treatment does not apply if the scrip for scrip rollover or wholly-owned company rollover applies to your ESIC shares. For more information, see How does the modified CGT treatment apply to a roll over . Venture capital investment Venture capital investors typically invest in a VCLP, an ESVCLP or an AFOF to diversify their portfolio of venture capital assets. A VCLP, ESVCLP or an AFOF is an intermediary that invests in shares and units and it is taxed on a 'flow through' basis. The partners of a VCLP, an ESVCLP or an AFOF make a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event relating to those shares and units, not the VCLP, the ESVCLP or the AFOF itself. For CGT purposes, each partner owns a proportion of each share or unit and calculates a capital gain or capital loss on their share of each share or unit. A capital gain or capital loss on your share of each share or unit may be disregarded. For more information, see Venture capital and early stage venture capital limited partnerships . Carried interest (CGT event K9) The carried interest of a general partner is the partner's entitlement to a distribution from the VCLP, the ESVCLP or the AFOF, normally contingent on profits attained for the limited partners in a VCLP, the ESVCLP or the AFOF. You have a capital gain when you become entitled to receive a payment of a carried interest under CGT event K9. Non-assessable payments You may need to adjust the cost base of shares or units for CGT calculations if you receive a non-assessable payment without disposing of your shares or units. A payment or distribution can include money and property. The amount of the non-assessable payment is adjusted to exclude certain amounts relating to a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF and an ESIC. You need to keep accurate records of the amount and date of any non-assessable payments on your shares and units.

You need to keep accurate records of the amount and date of any non-assessable payments on your shares and units. Non-assessable payments after a recent restructure As a result of some stapling arrangements, some investors in managed funds have received units which have a very low cost base. The payment of certain non-assessable amounts in excess of the cost base of the units will result in these investors making a capital gain. Non-assessable payments from a company (CGT event G1) Non-assessable payments to shareholders are not very common and would generally be made only if a company has shareholder approval to reduce its share capital. If you receive a non-assessable payment from a company (that is, a payment that is not a dividend or an amount that is taken to be a dividend for tax purposes), you need to adjust the cost base of the shares at the time of the payment. These payments will often be referred to as a return of capital. If the amount of the non-assessable payment is not more than the cost base of the shares at the time of payment, you reduce the cost base and reduced cost base by the amount of the payment. You make a capital gain if the amount of the non-assessable payment is more than the cost base of the shares. The amount of the capital gain is equal to the excess. If you make a capital gain, you reduce the cost base and reduced cost base of the shares to nil. You cannot make a capital loss from the receipt of a non-assessable payment. Interim liquidation distributions that are not dividends can be treated in the same way as other non-assessable payments under CGT event G1 . The exception is if the payment is made to you by a liquidator after the declaration and the company is dissolved within 18\u00a0months of such a payment. In this case, you include the payment as capital proceeds on the cancellation of your shares (rather than you making a capital gain at the time of the payment). In preparing your tax return, you may delay declaring any capital gain until your shares are cancelled unless you are advised by the liquidator in writing that the company will not cease to exist within 18 months of you receiving the payment. Example 45: Non-assessable payments Rob bought 1,500 shares in RAP Ltd on 1\u00a0July 1994 for $5 each, including brokerage and stamp duty. On 30\u00a0November 2007, as part of a shareholder-approved scheme for the reduction of RAP Ltd\u2019s share capital, he received a non-assessable payment of 50 cents per share. Just before Rob received the payment, the cost base of each share (without indexation) was $5. As the amount of the payment is not more than the cost base (without indexation), he reduces the cost base of each share at 30\u00a0November 2007 by the amount of the payment to $4.50 ($5.00 \u2212 50\u00a0cents). As Rob has chosen not to index the cost base, he can claim the CGT discount if he disposes of the shares in the future. End of example Non-assessable payments from a unit trust (CGT event E4 or E10) Unit trusts often make non-assessable payments to unit holders. Depending on whether that non-assessable payment is greater than or less than the cost base of your units in respect of which your payment is received, you will either make a capital gain or have the cost base and reduced cost base of your units reduced. Your CGT obligations in this situation are explained in Trust non-assessable payments (CGT event E4) . For units you sold during the 2022\u201323 income year and with respect to which you received a non-assessable payment prior to selling, you must determine your CGT event E4 (or E10) position separate to the calculation of any CGT event A1 position that happens on the sale of the units. This may necessarily include adjusting the cost base and reduced cost base of the units for the non-assessable payments you received during 2022\u201323 up to the date of sale.", "start_char_idx": 80892, "end_char_idx": 85223, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e74d1fdd-b307-4663-ae5a-ef37bf1ece2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e74d1fdd-b307-4663-ae5a-ef37bf1ece2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7fc83606-e1ea-4ed0-a694-2cc10512cff0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "cbb37af8ffb7216a918389c1b9c9b566c82740f7f1daff628b835a60576dc9d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f9a8e65-af2c-4686-b8cf-e909b72918c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_name": "part-a-about-capital-gains-tax.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 94394, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "71f0b46bbd7317069f2864d05d524516d32b21f37046a2002fc868e08167557f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "53f313fb-cc2c-4ef3-bd98-3692948aaa61", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b651a1738b51e43cfe396f9e1400a26d9cc8bb08f9c3a99f470e5c165c721d37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4c5f9498c909df077edc540f8ed3f192ed18871b3a28c4d647494d52369d7243", "text": "Depending on whether that non-assessable payment is greater than or less than the cost base of your units in respect of which your payment is received, you will either make a capital gain or have the cost base and reduced cost base of your units reduced.

If the unit or interest is not in an AMIT, the CGT event is E4, and if the unit or interest is in an AMIT, the CGT event is E10. Non-assessable payments under a demerger If you received a non-assessable payment under an eligible demerger , you do not adjust the cost base and the reduced cost base of your shares or units. Instead, you adjust your cost base and reduced cost base under the demerger rules. You may have made a capital gain on the non-assessable payment if it exceeded the cost base of your original shares or units, although you are able to choose a CGT rollover. An eligible demerger is one that happened on or after 1\u00a0July 2002 and satisfies certain tests. The head entity will normally advise shareholders or unit holders if this is the case. Investments in foreign hybrids A foreign hybrid is an entity that is taxed in Australia as a company but taxed overseas as a partnership. This can include a limited partnership, a limited liability partnership and a US limited liability company. If you have an investment in a foreign hybrid (referred to as being a member of a foreign hybrid), you are treated for Australian tax purposes as having an interest in each asset of the partnership. As a consequence, any capital gain or capital loss made in relation to the assets of a foreign hybrid is taken to be made by the member. General value shifting regime (GVSR) If you own shares in a company or units (or other fixed interests) in a trust, you may be affected by value shifting rules . These rules may apply to you if: you have interests in a company or trust in which equity or loan interests have been issued or bought back at other than market value, or varied such that the values of some interests have increased while others have decreased (direct value shifts on interests), or you have interests in an entity whose dealings (such as providing loans or other services, or transferring assets) with another entity are neither at market value nor arm\u2019s length and both entities are under the same control or ownership (indirect value shifting). For more information, see Guide to the general value shifting regime . Using the capital gain or capital loss worksheet for shares In example 46, Tony uses the indexation method, the discount method and the 'other' method to calculate his capital gain so he can decide which method gives him the best result. To calculate your capital gain when you acquire or dispose of shares, see how to complete the Capital gain or capital loss worksheet 2023 . For a description of each method and when you can use each one, see How to work out your capital gain or capital loss . Remember that if you bought and sold your shares within 12\u00a0months, you must use the 'other' method to calculate your capital gain. If you owned your shares for 12\u00a0months or more, you may be able to use either the discount method or the indexation method, whichever gives you the better result. Because each share in a parcel of shares is a separate CGT asset, you can use different methods to work out the amount of any capital gain for shares within a parcel. This may be to your advantage if you have capital losses to apply. See Example\u00a012 . Example 46: Using all 3 methods to calculate a capital gain On 1\u00a0July 1994, Tony bought 10,000 shares in Kimbin Ltd for $2 each. He paid brokerage of $250 and stamp duty of $50.

He needs to keep separate records for each parcel and apportion the sale brokerage of $500 and stamp duty of $50. The completed Capital gain or capital loss worksheet (PDF 95KB) This link will download a file shows how Tony can evaluate which method gives him the best result. He uses the 'other' method for the 2,500 shares he owned for less than 12\u00a0months, as he has no choice: $7,500 capital proceeds \u2212 $4,610 cost base = $2,890 capital gain For the 10,000 shares he has owned for more than 12\u00a0months, his capital gain using the indexation method would be: $30,000 capital proceeds \u2212 $22,831 cost base = $7,169 capital gain This means his net capital gain would be: $2,890 'other' method + $7,169 indexation method = $10,059 net capital gain For the 10,000 shares if Tony uses the discount method instead (assuming he has no capital losses), his capital gain would be: $30,000 \u2212 $20,740 = $9,260 He applies the CGT discount of 50%: $9,260 \u00d7 50% = $4,630 This means his net capital gain would be: $2,890 'other' method + $4,630 discount method = $7,520 net capital gain In this case, for the parcel of 10,000 shares he would choose the discount method rather than the indexation method, as it gives him the better result (a lower net capital gain). End of example Dividend paid by a listed investment company (LIC) that includes LIC capital gain If an LIC pays a dividend to you that includes an LIC capital gain amount, you may be entitled to an income tax deduction. You can claim a deduction if: you are an individual you were an Australian resident when an LIC paid you a dividend, and the dividend included an LIC capital gain amount. The amount of the deduction is 50% of the LIC capital gain amount. The LIC capital gain amount will be shown separately on your dividend statement. You do not show the LIC capital gain amount at question 18 in your supplementary tax return. Example 47: LIC capital gain Ben, an Australian resident, is a shareholder in XYZ Ltd, a LIC.

Menu Search Real estate and main residence Last updated 9 July 2023 Print or Download Explains your CGT obligations for real estate. The CGT exemption for a main residence is also explained. CGT and real estate Real estate includes vacant blocks of land, business premises, rental properties, holiday houses and hobby farms. Apart from the main residence rules, capital gains and capital losses on real estate are worked out under the rules set out earlier in this guide. Land is a CGT asset. In some cases, improvements made to land are treated as separate CGT assets, see Separate assets . A depreciating asset that is found in a building (for example, carpet or a hot-water system) is also taken to be a separate CGT asset from the building. When a CGT event happens to your property, you must work out a capital gain or capital loss for each CGT asset it comprises (or balancing adjustment in the case of depreciating assets sold with the property). The most common CGT event that happens to real estate is its sale or disposal, CGT event A1. The time of the event is: when you enter into the contract for the disposal if there is no contract, when the change of ownership occurs if the asset is compulsorily acquired by an entity, the earliest of when you received compensation from the entity the entity became the asset\u2019s owner the entity entered it under a power of compulsory acquisition the entity took possession under that power. If land is disposed of under a contract, it is taken to have been disposed of when the contract is entered into, not the settlement date. The fact that a contract is subject to a condition, such as finance approval, will generally not affect this date. You are not required to include any capital gain or capital loss in your tax return for the relevant income year until settlement occurs. When settlement occurs, you must include any capital gain or capital loss in your tax return for the income year in which the contract was made. If an assessment has already been made for that income year, you may need to have that assessment amended. Where an assessment is amended to include a net capital gain and a liability for shortfall interest charge (SIC) arises, remission of that interest charge will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Generally, it would be expected that the SIC would be remitted in full where requests for amendment are lodged within a reasonable time after the date of settlement, which, in most cases, is considered to be one month. If you consider that the SIC should be remitted, you should provide reasons why when you request the amendment to your assessment. For more information, see Shortfall interest charge . Rules to keep in mind There are a few rules to keep in mind when you calculate your capital gain or capital loss from real estate, in particular rules relating to: the costs of owning the real estate cost base adjustments for capital works deductions. Costs of owning You do not include rates, insurance, land tax, maintenance and interest on money you borrowed to buy the property or finance improvements to it in the reduced cost base. You only include them in the cost base if you: acquired the property under a contract entered into after 20\u00a0August 1991 (or if you didn\u2019t acquire it under a contract, you became the owner after that date) could not claim a deduction for the costs because you did not use the property to produce assessable income, for example, it was vacant land, your main residence, or a holiday home during the period. Cost base adjustments for capital works deductions In working out a capital gain for property that you used to produce assessable income (such as a rental property or business premises), you may need to exclude from the cost base and reduced cost base capital works deductions you have claimed in any income year (or omitted to claim, but can still claim, because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired).

Major capital improvements to a dwelling acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 . You must exclude from the cost base of a CGT asset (including a building, structure or other capital improvement to land that is treated as a separate asset for CGT purposes) the amount of capital works deductions you claimed (or omitted to but can still claim because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired) for the asset if you acquired the asset: after 7:30pm AEST on 13\u00a0May 1997, or before that time and the expenditure that gave rise to the capital works deductions was incurred after 30\u00a0June 1999. However, if you omitted to claim capital works deductions because you did not have sufficient information to determine the amount and nature of the construction expenditure, there is no need to exclude the amount of such deductions from the cost base of the CGT asset. Reduced cost base You exclude the amount of the capital works deductions you claimed (or omitted to claim but can still claim because the period for amending the relevant income tax assessment has not expired) from the reduced cost base. However, if you omitted to claim capital works deductions because you did not have sufficient information to determine the amount and nature of the construction expenditure, there is no need to exclude the amount of such deductions from the reduced cost base of the CGT asset. Example 53: Capital works deduction Zoran acquired a rental property on 1\u00a0July 1998 for $200,000. Before disposing of the property on 30\u00a0June 2023, he had claimed $10,000 in capital works deductions. At the time of disposal, the cost base of the property was $210,250. Zoran must reduce the cost base of the property by $10,000 to $200,250. End of example Rollover There is generally no rollover or exemption for a capital gain you make when you sell an asset and put the proceeds into a superannuation fund. There is also no general exemption or rollover when you use the proceeds to purchase an identical or similar asset, or you transfer an asset into a superannuation fund. For example, a rollover is not available if you: sell a rental property and put the proceeds into a superannuation fund, or use the proceeds to purchase another rental property. A rollover may be available in special circumstances, in particular for: destruction compulsory acquisition of property or marriage or relationship breakdown. However, an asset or the capital proceeds from the sale of an asset may be transferred into a superannuation fund in order to satisfy certain conditions under the small business retirement exemption.

Sale of a rental property Example 54 shows how you would calculate your capital gain on the sale of your rental property. The sample worksheet (PDF 95KB) This link will download a file shows how you would complete the Capital gain or capital loss worksheet for this example. Example 54: Sale of a rental property Brett purchased a residential rental property on 1\u00a0July 1997. The price he paid was $150,000, of which $6,000 was attributable to depreciating assets. He also paid $20,000 in total for pest and building inspections, stamp duty and solicitor\u2019s fees. In the next few years, Brett incurred the following expenses on the property: interest on money borrowed $10,000 rates and land tax $8,000 deductible (non-capital) repairs $15,000 Total $33,000 Brett cannot include the expenses of $33,000 in the cost base, as he was able to claim a deduction for them. When Brett decided to sell the property, a real estate agent advised him that if he spent around $30,000 on major structural improvements, the property would be valued at around $500,000. The major structural improvements were completed on 1\u00a0October 2022 at a cost of $30,000.", "start_char_idx": 3985, "end_char_idx": 8538, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b73d182-8c13-49f5-975b-f12488300afd": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b73d182-8c13-49f5-975b-f12488300afd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cce505b5-f75a-4f8d-8416-22207decc5e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "31e87b1391dce956008d679e583378261fbd54ab17db10a86f6d8b13c2647d2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fb3d081-ecda-4abd-ba7e-482130e4bd8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "951797efc0f67f94bebd29986e2fe955f70d054084755a09c22aa901d8856f66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "969f4150-a50b-4bec-bb36-8cfed5c8c87d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d056bd89940bd9d019d9c1bd39bf3db808663b778b073e241ff1e60e5446b8d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b6aae5beb55e7e458611e970d0667dec9678425b04f7c4071c53a970ecc061e2", "text": "The price he paid was $150,000, of which $6,000 was attributable to depreciating assets.

Brett writes $289,755 at question 18 \u2013 label H Total current year capital gains in his supplementary tax return. Brett must also make balancing adjustment calculations for his depreciating assets. Because he used the property 100% for taxable purposes, he will not make a capital gain or capital loss from the depreciating assets. End of example Investing in affordable housing An additional CGT discount of up to 10% is allowed to Australian resident individuals who invest in affordable housing. A property qualifies as 'affordable' housing if rent is charged at below market rate, and it is made available for eligible tenants on low to moderate incomes. The property must be managed by an eligible community housing provider (CHP). Only dwellings that are Australian residential premises can be used to provide affordable housing. Commercial residential premises do not qualify as affordable housing. Caravans, mobile homes and houseboats are not considered residential premises. The additional affordable housing capital gain discount applies to CGT events occurring on or after 30\u00a0December 2020. Eligibility for the affordable housing CGT discount The following conditions must be met to qualify for up to 10% additional capital gain discount for investing in affordable housing: residential premises \u2013 the dwelling is Taxable Australian Real Property (TARP) and is residential premises that is not commercial residential premises and is tenanted or available to be tenanted property management \u2013 the tenancy of the dwelling or its occupancy is exclusively managed by an eligible CHP affordable housing certification \u2013 the eligible CHP has given each entity that holds an ownership interest in the dwelling certification that the dwelling was used to provide affordable housing NRAS \u2013 no entity that has an ownership interest in the dwelling is entitled to receive a National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) incentive for the NRAS year, and MIT membership \u2013 if the ownership interest in the dwelling is owned by a Managed Investment Trust (MIT), the tenant does not have an interest in the MIT that passes the non-portfolio test.", "start_char_idx": 7772, "end_char_idx": 12258, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "969f4150-a50b-4bec-bb36-8cfed5c8c87d": {"__data__": {"id_": "969f4150-a50b-4bec-bb36-8cfed5c8c87d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cce505b5-f75a-4f8d-8416-22207decc5e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "31e87b1391dce956008d679e583378261fbd54ab17db10a86f6d8b13c2647d2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b73d182-8c13-49f5-975b-f12488300afd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "b6aae5beb55e7e458611e970d0667dec9678425b04f7c4071c53a970ecc061e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "79b9da6c-0689-4e01-be25-9b7ead9a4896", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "19c521eac0f8781a5d8a68a1c2fc4548db1bfc1b7334603160e928cd6ec694ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d056bd89940bd9d019d9c1bd39bf3db808663b778b073e241ff1e60e5446b8d0", "text": "Eligibility for the affordable housing CGT discount The following conditions must be met to qualify for up to 10% additional capital gain discount for investing in affordable housing: residential premises \u2013 the dwelling is Taxable Australian Real Property (TARP) and is residential premises that is not commercial residential premises and is tenanted or available to be tenanted property management \u2013 the tenancy of the dwelling or its occupancy is exclusively managed by an eligible CHP affordable housing certification \u2013 the eligible CHP has given each entity that holds an ownership interest in the dwelling certification that the dwelling was used to provide affordable housing NRAS \u2013 no entity that has an ownership interest in the dwelling is entitled to receive a National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) incentive for the NRAS year, and MIT membership \u2013 if the ownership interest in the dwelling is owned by a Managed Investment Trust (MIT), the tenant does not have an interest in the MIT that passes the non-portfolio test. To qualify for the discount, an investor must have provided affordable housing on or after 1\u00a0January 2018 for a period, or intermittent periods, totalling at least 1,095 days. The investor must have invested either directly, or through a trust including where there is an interposed entity between the investor and the trust. The trust that provides the affordable housing and any interposed entities may be a trust, a managed investment trust or partnership, but cannot be a public unit trust or superannuation fund. How to calculate the additional CGT discount The additional affordable housing CGT discount percentage, which will be 10% or less, is calculated as follows: (CGT discount percent \u00f7 5)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(Affordable housing days \u00f7 Total ownership days) where: CGT discount percentage is the discount of up to 50% on capital gains. Affordable housing days are the number of days the dwelling was used to provide affordable housing (on or after 1\u00a0January 2018) during its ownership period (and shown on the affordable housing certificate), less the number of days when the individual receiving the affordable housing capital gains discount was a foreign or temporary resident. Total ownership days are the number of days the dwelling was held from the time it was acquired until a CGT event occurred to it, excluding any period of foreign or temporary residency after 8\u00a0May 2012. Affordable housing certificate If you invested directly in affordable housing, you should have received an annual affordable housing certificate from your CHP showing the number of days your investment was used to provide affordable housing. If you invested in affordable housing through a trust or managed investment trust, you may need to contact the trustee to get the number of affordable housing days in order to work out your additional affordable housing CGT discount percentage. Example 55: Working out the aggregate period and affordable housing discount On 1\u00a0February 2019, Lisa purchased a dwelling that is residential premises. During her ownership assume Lisa uses the dwelling as follows: left it vacant and undertook repairs from when she acquired it on 1\u00a0February 2019 (the acquisition date for CGT purposes) until 1\u00a0March 2019 (29\u00a0days) rented it out through a CHP as affordable housing from 2\u00a0March 2019 until 4\u00a0February 2023 (1,436\u00a0days) rented it out through a real estate property manager at market rates (that is, not providing affordable housing) from 5\u00a0February 2023 until 31\u00a0May 2023 (116 days), and vacated the property and prepared it for sale on and after 1\u00a0June 2023 (23\u00a0days).

As Lisa used the dwelling to provide affordable housing for more than 1,095\u00a0days, she would be eligible for the additional affordable housing capital gains discount (assuming the dwelling meets the other requirements). Lisa's affordable housing capital gain discount percentage is equal to: (capital gain discount percentage \u00f7 5) \u00d7 (Affordable housing days \u00f7 Total ownership days) She works this out as: (50% \u00f7 5) \u00d7 (1,436 \u00f7 1,604) = 8.95% (this is the discount percent available for the provision of affordable housing) The discount percentage is equal to the sum of the capital gain discount percentage and the affordable housing discount capital gain percentage. That is, 58.95% (50% plus 8.95%). Lisa reduces her capital gain by the discount percentage. Lisa has capital gain of $100,000. She works out her capital gain after capital gains discount as: Capital gain \u00d7 (1 \u2212 discount %) $100,000 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 58.95%) = $41,050 Lisa includes only $41,050 of the $100,000 capital gain in her assessable income from her sale of this property, as a result of investment in affordable housing and meeting all its conditions. Note: Capital gains can also be reduced by capital losses and other concessions or exemptions, however, for the purpose of this example, these have not been factored in.

Other CGT events affecting real estate CGT event B1 happens to real estate if you enter into an agreement where the new owner is entitled to possession of the land or the receipt of rents and profits before becoming entitled to a transfer or conveyance of the land. Where this happens under a contract, it is known as a \u2018terms contract\u2019 and the new owner usually completes the purchase by paying the balance of the purchase price and receiving the instrument of transfer and title deeds. It may also happen where an agreement is made with a relative or other party to use and enjoy the property for a specified period, after which title to the property passes to them. It will not happen where, under an arrangement, title to a property may pass at an unspecified time in the future. CGT event B1 happens when use and enjoyment of the land is first obtained by the new owner. Use and enjoyment of the land from a practical point of view takes place at the time the new owner gets possession of the land or the date the new owner becomes entitled to the receipt of rents and profits. If the agreement falls through before completion and title to the land does not pass to the new owner, you may be entitled to amend your assessment for the year in which CGT event B1 happened. CGT event C1 happens if an asset is lost or destroyed. This event may happen if, for example, a building on your land is destroyed by fire. Your capital proceeds for CGT event C1 happening include any insurance proceeds you may receive for the loss or destruction. The market value substitution rule for capital proceeds that generally applies if you receive no capital proceeds does not apply if CGT event C1 happens. For more information, see Loss, destruction or compulsory acquisition of an asset . CGT event D1 happens if you give someone a right to reside in a dwelling. The capital proceeds include money (but not rent) and the value of any property you receive. The market value substitution rule for capital proceeds (see Definitions ) applies if: the amount of capital proceeds you receive is more or less than the market value of the right, and you and the person you granted the right to were not dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length in connection with the event. CGT event D2 happens if you grant an option to a person or an entity, or renew or extend an option that you had granted. The amount of your capital gain or capital loss from CGT event D2 is the difference between what you receive for granting the right and any expenditure you incurred on it. The CGT discount does not apply to CGT event D2.", "start_char_idx": 14844, "end_char_idx": 19116, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "882665ea-5962-405c-90a3-ef2f6700b08d": {"__data__": {"id_": "882665ea-5962-405c-90a3-ef2f6700b08d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cce505b5-f75a-4f8d-8416-22207decc5e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "31e87b1391dce956008d679e583378261fbd54ab17db10a86f6d8b13c2647d2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "79b9da6c-0689-4e01-be25-9b7ead9a4896", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "19c521eac0f8781a5d8a68a1c2fc4548db1bfc1b7334603160e928cd6ec694ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "51326e47-2afa-409d-9372-e9f478fdc031", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ba68cf22778911e6e63bd883a17187ec6195b794fdf3fa55b7c9d7b3ff0f9f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0a3acdf5a5e544386e5f6167595638a231fef67a4049f4a7901c48844cd58877", "text": "For more information, see Loss, destruction or compulsory acquisition of an asset .

On 30\u00a0June 2022, you granted her an option to purchase your land within 12\u00a0months for $200,000. Colleen pays you $10,000 for the grant of the option. You incur legal fees of $500. You made a capital gain in the 2021\u201322 income year of $9,500. End of example Exercise of an option If the option you granted is later exercised, you ignore any capital gain or capital loss you made from the grant, renewal or extension. You may have to amend your income tax assessment for an earlier income year. Similarly, any capital gain or capital loss that the grantee would otherwise make from the exercise of the option is disregarded. The effect of the exercise of an option depends on whether the option was a \u2018call option\u2019 or a \u2018put option\u2019. A call option is one that binds the grantor to dispose of an asset. A put option binds the grantor to acquire an asset. Example 57: Granting of an option (continued) On 1\u00a0February 2023, Colleen exercised the option you granted her. You disregard the capital gain that you made in 2021\u201322 income year and you request an amendment of your income tax assessment to exclude that amount. The $10,000 you received for the grant of the option is considered to be part of the capital proceeds for the sale of your property in the 2022\u201323 income year. Your capital gain or capital loss from the property is the difference between its cost base or reduced cost base and $210,000. End of example CGT event D4 happens if you enter into a conservation covenant after 15\u00a0June 2000 over land that you own and if you receive capital proceeds for entering into the covenant. From 1\u00a0July 2002, CGT event D4 also happens if you receive no capital proceeds for entering into the covenant and you can claim a tax deduction for entering into the covenant. One of the conditions for a tax deduction is that the covenant is entered into with a deductible gift recipient or an Australian Government agency (that is, the Commonwealth, a state, a territory or one of their authorities). A \u2018conservation covenant\u2019 is a covenant that: restricts or prohibits certain activities on the land that could degrade the environmental value of the land is permanent and binding on current and future land owners (by way of registration on the title to the land where possible), and is approved by the Environment Minister (including those entered into under a program approved by that Minister). If CGT event D4 happens, you calculate your capital gain by comparing your capital proceeds from entering into the covenant with the portion of the cost base of the land that is attributable to the covenant. Similarly, you calculate your capital loss by comparing your capital proceeds from entering into the covenant with the portion of the reduced cost base of the land that is attributable to the covenant. The market value substitution rule for capital proceeds that generally applies if you receive no consideration for a CGT event does not apply if CGT event D4 happens. Instead, the capital proceeds are equal to the amount you can claim as a tax deduction for entering into the covenant.", "start_char_idx": 18215, "end_char_idx": 22308, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51326e47-2afa-409d-9372-e9f478fdc031": {"__data__": {"id_": "51326e47-2afa-409d-9372-e9f478fdc031", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cce505b5-f75a-4f8d-8416-22207decc5e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "31e87b1391dce956008d679e583378261fbd54ab17db10a86f6d8b13c2647d2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "882665ea-5962-405c-90a3-ef2f6700b08d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "0a3acdf5a5e544386e5f6167595638a231fef67a4049f4a7901c48844cd58877", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a4b04fa-0a36-45d3-b781-8ec787aef30c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4faed00abc3b9126c50d223f063a44fdde984e29b6fa9d2fc10049a3a443a13b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4ba68cf22778911e6e63bd883a17187ec6195b794fdf3fa55b7c9d7b3ff0f9f3", "text": "If CGT event D4 happens, you calculate your capital gain by comparing your capital proceeds from entering into the covenant with the portion of the cost base of the land that is attributable to the covenant. Similarly, you calculate your capital loss by comparing your capital proceeds from entering into the covenant with the portion of the reduced cost base of the land that is attributable to the covenant. The market value substitution rule for capital proceeds that generally applies if you receive no consideration for a CGT event does not apply if CGT event D4 happens. Instead, the capital proceeds are equal to the amount you can claim as a tax deduction for entering into the covenant. Calculate the relevant portion of the cost base and reduced cost base attributable to the covenant using this formula: A \u00d7 (B \u00f7 C) Where: A is cost base (reduced cost base) B is capital proceeds from entering into the covenant over land C is those capital proceeds plus the market value of the land just after you enter into the covenant As the conservation covenant will affect the value of the entire land you must use the cost base of the entire land in calculating the cost base apportioned to the covenant. This is the case even if the covenant specifically states within its terms that the restrictions as to use only apply to part of the land. CGT event D4 will not happen if you receive no capital proceeds and the conditions for a tax deduction for entering into the covenant are not satisfied. In this case, CGT event D1 will apply. CGT events involving leases There are a number of CGT events that may apply to the lease of land. CGT event F1 happens if you grant a lease to a person or entity or if you extend or renew a lease that you had previously granted. In the case of a long-term lease (one that may be expected to continue for at least 50\u00a0years), you can choose to treat the grant (renewal or extension) of the lease as a part disposal of the underlying leased property. Example 58: Receiving an amount for granting a lease Elisabeth operates a profitable footwear retailing business and wishes to lease some shop space in a prestigious location in the Sydney CBD. However, the demand for shop space in the locality is great, and competition between prospective tenants is fierce. In order to ensure that she secures the lease of the particular shop space that she wants, Elisabeth pays John (the owner of the shop space) a premium of $6,000 in consideration for the grant of that particular lease. She enters into the lease on 6\u00a0September 2008, and John incurs stamp duty of $300 and solicitor\u2019s fees of $500 on the grant of the lease. John makes a capital gain of $5,200 from CGT event F1: capital proceeds: $6,000 less incidental costs: (that is, stamp duty of $300 and solicitors fees of $500) $800 capital gain $5,200 For Elisabeth, this transaction results in CGT event C2 when the lease expires. End of example The amount of your capital gain or capital loss from CGT event F1 is the difference between any premium you got for granting the lease and the expenditure you incurred in granting it. The CGT discount does not apply to CGT event F1. The market value substitution rule for capital proceeds that generally applies if you receive no consideration for a CGT event does not apply if CGT event F1 happens. CGT event F2 You can choose for CGT event F2 to apply (rather than CGT event F1) when you grant, renew or extend a long-term lease (at least 50\u00a0years). It can apply if you are the owner of the underlying land or if you grant a sub-lease.

For any later CGT event that happens to the land or the lessor\u2019s lease of it, its cost base and reduced cost base (including the cost base and reduced cost base of any building, part of a building, structure or improvement that is treated as a separate CGT asset) excludes: any expenditure incurred before CGT event F2 happens the cost of any depreciating asset for which the lessor has deducted or can deduct an amount for its decline in value. The 4th element of the property\u2019s cost base and reduced cost base includes any payment by the lessor to the lessee to vary or waive a term of the lease or for the forfeiture or surrender of the lease, reduced by the amount of any input tax credit to which the lessor is entitled for the variation or waiver. CGT event F3 happens if you make a payment to a lessee to vary a lease. You can only make a capital loss from this CGT event. Your capital loss is equal to the expenditure you incurred to change the lease. CGT event F4 happens if you (as lessee) receive a payment from the lessor for agreeing to vary or waive a term of the lease. You cannot make a capital loss from this CGT event. You will only make a capital gain from CGT event F4 if the amount of the payment you received exceeds the cost base of your lease at the time when the term is varied. In other cases, you will be required to adjust the cost base of your lease. The market value substitution rule for capital proceeds that applies if you do not receive market value for a CGT event does not apply if CGT event F4 happens. Example 59: Payment to lessee for change in lease Sam is the lessor of a commercial property. His tenant, Peter, currently holds a 3-year lease over the property, which has another 26 months to run. A business associate of Sam\u2019s wishes to lease the property from Sam for a 10-year period, beginning in 6 months\u2019 time, for twice the rent that Peter is currently paying. Sam approaches Peter with an offer of $5,000 cash for Peter to agree to vary the terms of the lease so that the lease will expire in 6\u00a0months\u2019 time. Peter agrees to vary the terms on 10\u00a0August 2022. Sam will make a capital loss of $5,000 from CGT event F3 happening: capital proceeds: $0 less incidental costs and expenditure incurred: $5,000 Capital gain or loss \u2212$5,000 For Peter, this transaction results in CGT event F4 happening. The cost base of Peter\u2019s lease at the time of the variation was $500. He makes a capital gain of $4,500 ($5,000 \u2212 $500). End of example You disregard any capital loss you make from the expiry, forfeiture, surrender or assignment of a lease (except one granted for 99\u00a0years or more) if you did not use it solely or mainly for the purpose of producing assessable income, for example, if you used it for private purposes. CGT event F5 happens if you, as lessor, receive a payment for changing a lease. The amount of your capital gain or capital loss from CGT event F5 is the difference between what you receive for changing the lease and any expenditure you incurred on it. The CGT discount does not apply to CGT event F5. Subdivision of land If you subdivide a block of land, each block that results is registered with a separate title. For CGT purposes, the original land parcel is divided into 2 or more separate assets. Subdividing land does not result in a CGT event if you retain ownership of the subdivided blocks. Therefore, you do not make a capital gain or a capital loss at the time of the subdivision. However, you may make a capital gain or capital loss when you sell the subdivided blocks.

For more information, see TD\u00a097/3 Income tax: capital gains: if a parcel of land acquired after 19\u00a0September 1985 is subdivided into lots ('blocks'), do Parts 3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 treat a disposal of a block of the subdivided land as the disposal of part of an asset (the original land parcel) or the disposal of an asset in its own right (the subdivided block)? When the profit is ordinary income You may have made a profit from the subdivision and sale of land which occurred in the ordinary course of your business or which involved a commercial transaction or business operation entered into with the purpose of making a profit. In this case, the profit is ordinary income (see TR\u00a092/3 Income tax: whether profits on isolated transactions are income ). You reduce any capital gain from the land by the amount otherwise included in your assessable income. Example 60: Land purchased before 20\u00a0September 1985, land subdivided after that date and house built on subdivided land In 1983, Mike bought a block of land that was less than 2 hectares. He subdivided the land into 2 blocks in May 2022 and began building a house on the rear block, which he finished in August 2022 and did not use as his main residence. He sold the rear block (including the house) in October 2022 for $650,000. Mike got a valuation from a qualified valuer who valued the rear block at $550,000 and the house at $100,000. The construction cost of the house was $85,000. Mike acquired the rear block before 20\u00a0September 1985, so it is not subject to CGT. As the new house was constructed after 20\u00a0September 1985 on land purchased before that date, the house is taken to be a separate asset from the land. Mike is taken to have acquired the house in May 2022, when he began building it. Mike made a capital gain of $15,000 ($100,000\u00a0\u2212\u00a0$85,000) when he sold the house because he did not use it as his main residence. As Mike had owned the house for less than 12\u00a0months, he used the 'other' method to calculate his capital gain. End of example Example 61: Dwelling purchased on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 and land subdivided after that date Kym bought a house on a 0.2 hectare block of land in June 2022 for $350,000. The house was valued at $120,000 and the land at $230,000. Kym lived in the house as her main residence. She incurred $12,000 in stamp duty and legal fees purchasing the property. Kym found the block was too big for her to maintain. In January 2023, she subdivided the land into 2 blocks of equal size \u2013 the front one with the house on it. She incurred $10,000 in survey, legal and subdivision application fees, and $1,000 to connect water and drainage to the rear block. In March 2023, she sold the rear block for $130,000. As Kym sold the rear block of land separately, the main residence exemption does not apply to that land.

As Kym had owned the land for less than 12\u00a0months, she uses the 'other' method to calculate her capital gain. Kym will get the full exemption for her house and the front block if she uses them as her main residence for the full period she owns them. End of example Amalgamation of title The amalgamation of the titles to various blocks of land that you own does not result in a CGT event happening. Land you acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 that is amalgamated with land acquired on or after that date retains its pre-CGT status. Example 62: Amalgamation of title On 1\u00a0April 1984, Robert bought a block of land. On 1\u00a0June 2008, he bought another block adjacent to the first one. Robert amalgamated the titles to the 2\u00a0blocks into one title. Robert is taken to have 2 separate assets. The first block continues to be treated as a pre-CGT asset. End of example Examples of CGT calculations affecting real estate There are a number of other examples in this guide that explain how to calculate your capital gain or capital loss on the sale of real estate: calculation of capital gain (including worksheet), where a person can choose the indexation or discount method to calculate their capital gain, see example\u00a013 calculation of capital gain on property owned for 12\u00a0months or less, see example\u00a09 recoupment of expenditure affecting CGT cost base calculation, see example\u00a06 deductions affecting CGT cost base calculations, see example\u00a053 and example\u00a054 . Main residence Generally, if you are an individual (not a company or trust) you can ignore a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event that happens to your ownership interest in a dwelling that is your main residence (also referred to as \u2018your home\u2019). However, special rules apply if the interest in the dwelling is held by the trustee of a Special Disability Trust. In such cases, the trustee of the Special Disability Trust will be eligible for any main residence exemption to the extent the individual principal beneficiary of the Special Disability Trust would have been if that individual principal beneficiary owned the interest in the dwelling.

This also applies to people who may otherwise be prevented from making contributions into superannuation due to: age work status, or contribution cap restrictions. There are various criteria to be eligible to make a downsizer contribution. To make a downsizer contribution, the capital gain or loss from the sale of the home must be disregarded, in whole or part, because the property has been treated as your main residence (for the purposes of the main residence exemption for CGT). A partial main residence CGT exemption (for the purposes of the downsizer contribution eligibility) may apply in a variety of situations, including where the home: was not your main residence for the entire period of ownership was used to produce assessable income (in whole or part) for a period of time during the ownership, or is on land greater than 2 hectares. You may not have a capital gain or loss to disregard because, for example: your home was a pre-CGT asset (that is, if it was acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985), or your spouse owned the home that was sold. If your home was a pre-CGT asset you can still make a downsizer contribution if would be entitled to such an exemption if your home was a CGT asset rather than a pre-CGT asset. If your home that was sold was only owned by one spouse, the spouse that did not have an ownership interest may also make a downsizer contribution, or have one made on their behalf, provided they meet all of the other requirements For more information, see Downsizing contributions into superannuation . What is a dwelling? A dwelling is anything that is used wholly or mainly for residential accommodation. Certain mobile homes can also be a dwelling. Examples of a dwelling are: a home or cottage an apartment or flat a strata title unit a unit in a retirement village a caravan, houseboat or other mobile home. Any land the dwelling is on is included as part of the dwelling, but it only qualifies for the main residence exemption if the land and the dwelling are sold together. Also, the exemption applies to a maximum of 2 hectares of land (including the land on which the dwelling is built). Any excess is subject to CGT. A building or a unit in a building, which is a dwelling, ceases to be a dwelling once you commence converting it into commercial premises. For more information, see Land adjacent to the dwelling . What is an ownership interest? In the case of a flat or home unit, you have an ownership interest if you have a: legal or equitable interest in a strata title in the flat or home unit licence or right to occupy the flat or home unit, or share in a company that owns a legal or equitable interest in the land on which the flat or home unit is constructed and that share gives you a right to occupy the flat or home unit. In the case of a dwelling that is not a flat or home unit, you have an ownership interest if you have a: legal or equitable interest in the land on which it is constructed, or licence or right to occupy it. In the case of land, you have an ownership interest if you have a: legal or equitable interest in it, or right to occupy it. An equitable interest may include life tenancy of a dwelling that you acquire, for example, under a deceased\u2019s will. When do you acquire an ownership interest? For the purposes of the main residence exemption, you have an ownership interest in a dwelling or land you acquire under a contract from the time you get legal ownership (unless you have a right to occupy it at an earlier time). You have legal ownership of a dwelling or land from the date of settlement of the contract of purchase (or if you have a right to occupy it at an earlier time, that time) until the date of settlement of the contract of sale.

An equitable interest may include life tenancy of a dwelling that you acquire, for example, under a deceased\u2019s will. When do you acquire an ownership interest? For the purposes of the main residence exemption, you have an ownership interest in a dwelling or land you acquire under a contract from the time you get legal ownership (unless you have a right to occupy it at an earlier time). You have legal ownership of a dwelling or land from the date of settlement of the contract of purchase (or if you have a right to occupy it at an earlier time, that time) until the date of settlement of the contract of sale. This period is called your ownership period. If the dwelling is on 2 hectares of land or less, is your main residence for the whole of the ownership period and you do not use it to produce assessable income, the home is fully exempt. Example 63: Full exemption Frank signed a contract on 14\u00a0August 1999 to purchase 0.1\u00a0hectare of land from a developer and to have a house constructed on the land. Under the contract, settlement did not occur until construction was completed on 26\u00a0October 2000. Frank moved into the house immediately upon settlement of the contract he had with the developer, that is, on 26\u00a0October 2000. He did not have a right to occupy the house at an earlier time under the purchase contract. He signed the contract to sell it on 25\u00a0May 2023 and settlement occurred on 20\u00a0July 2023. The house was Frank\u2019s main residence for the full period he owned it and he did not use any part of it to produce income. For CGT purposes, Frank is taken to have acquired the land on which the house was constructed on the date he entered into the contract, 14\u00a0August 1999. However, because the house was Frank\u2019s main residence for the whole period between settlement of the purchase contract and settlement of the sale contract, it is fully exempt. The period between when Frank entered into the purchase contract and started to live in the house (14\u00a0August 1999 to 25\u00a0October 2000) is ignored. This is because the relevant dates for the main residence exemption are the settlement dates or, if you had a right under the purchase contract to occupy the dwelling at an earlier time, that time until settlement of the sale contract. End of example Even though the settlement dates are used to calculate the period for which the main residence exemption applies, the dates you enter into the purchase and sale contracts are important. A CGT event occurs when you enter into the sale contract. You include any capital gain in your tax return for the income year in which the CGT event occurs. The dates you enter into the purchase and sale contracts are also relevant for determining what method you can use to work out your capital gain from your main residence. Example 64: Partial exemption The facts are the same as in the previous example except that Frank rented out the house from 26\u00a0October 2000, the date of settlement of the purchase contract, until 2\u00a0March 2002. Frank makes a capital gain of $90,000 on the house. To work out the part of the capital gain that is not exempt, Frank must determine how many days in his ownership period the dwelling was not his main residence. Frank had an ownership interest in the property from settlement of the purchase contract (26\u00a0October 2000) until settlement of the sale contract (20\u00a0July 2023), a total of 8,303 days. The period between the dates the purchase contract was signed (14\u00a0August 1999) and settled (25\u00a0October 2000) is ignored.

The following factors may be relevant in working out whether a dwelling is your main residence: the length of time you live there (there is no minimum time a person has to live in a home before it is considered to be their main residence) whether your family lives there whether you have moved your personal belongings into the home the address to which your mail is delivered your address on the electoral roll the connection of services (for example, phone, gas or electricity) your intention in occupying the dwelling. A mere intention to construct or occupy a dwelling as your main residence, without actually doing so, is not sufficient to get the exemption. If you were not a resident of Australia for tax purposes while you were living in the property you are unlikely to satisfy the requirements for the main residence exemption. In certain circumstances, you may choose to treat a dwelling as your main residence even though: you no longer live in it; for more information, see Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence , or you are yet to live in it, but will do so as soon as practicable after it is constructed, repaired or renovated and you will continue to live in it for at least 3 months; for more information, see Constructing, renovating or repairing a dwelling on land you already own . Moving into a dwelling A dwelling is considered to be your main residence from the time you acquired your ownership interest in it if you moved into it as soon as practicable after that time. If you purchased the dwelling, this would generally be the date of settlement of the purchase contract. However, if there is a delay in moving in because of illness or other unforeseen circumstances, the exemption may still be available from the time you acquired your ownership interest in the dwelling. If you could not move in because the dwelling was being rented to someone, you are not considered to have moved in as soon as practicable after you acquired your ownership interest. As mentioned earlier, there is a special rule that allows you to treat more than one dwelling as your main residence for a limited time if you are changing main residences, see Moving from one main residence to another . Example 65: Moving in as soon as practicable Mary signs a contract to buy a townhouse on 1\u00a0March 2023. She is to take possession when settlement occurs on 30\u00a0April 2023. On 11\u00a0March 2023, Mary is directed by her employer to go overseas on an assignment for 4 months, leaving on 25\u00a0March 2023. Mary moves into the townhouse on her return to Australia in late July 2023. Mary\u2019s overseas assignment was unforeseen at the time she bought the property. As she moved in as soon as practicable after settlement of the contract occurred, Mary can treat the townhouse as her main residence from the date of settlement until she moved in. End of example Land adjacent to the dwelling The land adjacent to a dwelling is also exempt if: during the period you owned it, the land is used mainly for private or domestic purposes in association with the dwelling the total area of the land around the dwelling, including the land on which it stands, is not greater than 2 hectares. If the land used for private purposes is greater than 2 hectares, you can choose which 2 hectares are exempt but the land you choose must include the land on which the dwelling is built.

End of example Land adjacent to the dwelling The land adjacent to a dwelling is also exempt if: during the period you owned it, the land is used mainly for private or domestic purposes in association with the dwelling the total area of the land around the dwelling, including the land on which it stands, is not greater than 2 hectares. If the land used for private purposes is greater than 2 hectares, you can choose which 2 hectares are exempt but the land you choose must include the land on which the dwelling is built. Land is adjacent to your dwelling if it is close to, near, adjoining or neighbouring the dwelling. If you sell any of the land adjacent to your dwelling separately from the dwelling, the land is not exempt. It is only exempt when sold with the dwelling. There is an exception if the dwelling is accidentally destroyed and you sell the vacant land or vacant land adjacent to your dwelling is compulsorily acquired. See: Destruction of dwelling and sale of land Compulsory acquisition of part of your main residence Any part of the land around a dwelling used to produce income is not exempt, even if the total land is less than 2 hectares. However, the dwelling and any buildings and other land used in association with it remain exempt if you do not use them to produce income. Example 66: Land used for private purposes Tim bought a home with 15\u00a0hectares of land in November 2000. He uses 10\u00a0hectares of the land to produce income and 5\u00a0hectares for private purposes. Tim can get the main residence exemption for the home and 2\u00a0hectares of land he selects out of the 5 hectares that are used for private purposes. Tim gets a valuation which states that the home and 2\u00a0hectares of land that he has selected are worth 2-thirds of the total value of the property. The relative values of the different parts of the property remained the same between the time of purchase and the time of sale. Tim entered into a contract to sell the property on 8\u00a0May 2022. The capital gain from the property is $150,000. Tim may claim the main residence exemption on the two-thirds of the capital gain attributable to the house and 2\u00a0hectares of land, that is, $100,000. Because he entered into the contract to acquire the property after 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999 and owned it for at least 12\u00a0months, Tim reduces his remaining $50,000 gain (attributable to the land) by the CGT discount of 50% after applying any capital losses. End of example Other structures associated with the dwelling A flat or home unit often includes areas (for example, a laundry, storeroom or garage) that are physically separate from the flat or home unit. As long as you use these areas primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with the flat or home unit for the whole period you own it, they are exempt on the same basis that the flat or home unit is exempt. However, if you dispose of one of these structures separately from the flat or home unit, they are not exempt. If one of these structures is compulsorily acquired without your flat or home unit also being acquired, see Compulsory acquisition of part of your main residence . Partial exemption Main residence for only part of the period you owned it If a CGT event happens to a dwelling you acquired on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 and that dwelling was not your main residence for the whole time you owned it, you get only a partial exemption. You calculate the part of the capital gain that is taxable as follows: A \u00d7 (B \u00f7 C) Where: A is total capital gain made from the CGT event B is number of days in your ownership period when the dwelling was not your main residence C is total number of days in your ownership period Example 67: Main residence for part of the ownership period Andrew bought a house on 1\u00a0hectare of land under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0July 1990 and moved in immediately.

On 1\u00a0July 1993, he moved out and began to rent out the house. He did not choose to treat the house as his main residence for the period after he moved out, although he could have done this under the continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence rule. The home first used to produce income rule does not apply because Andrew used the home to produce income before 21\u00a0August 1996.

End of example If a dwelling was not your main residence for the whole time you owned it, some special rules may entitle you to a full exemption or to extend the partial exemption you would otherwise get. These rules apply to land or a dwelling if you: choose to treat the dwelling as your main residence, even though you no longer live in it; see Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence moved into the dwelling as soon as practicable after its purchase; see Moving into a dwelling are changing main residences; see Moving from one main residence to another are yet to live in the dwelling but will do so as soon as practicable after it is constructed, repaired or renovated and you will continue to live in it for at least 3 months; see Constructing, renovating or repairing a dwelling on land you already own sell vacant land after your main residence is accidentally destroyed; see Destruction of dwelling and sale of land . Note: You cannot choose to treat a building or a unit in a building as your main residence if immediately after you cease to occupy it as your main residence you commence converting it into commercial premises. Dwelling used to produce income Usually, you cannot get the full main residence exemption if you acquired your dwelling on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, used it as your main residence and you: used any part of it to produce income during all or part of the period you owned it, and would be allowed a deduction for interest had you incurred on money borrowed to acquire the dwelling (interest deductibility test). The interest deductibility test applies regardless of whether you actually borrowed money to acquire your dwelling. You must apply it on the assumption that you did borrow money to acquire the dwelling. If you rent out part of your home, you would be entitled to deduct part of the interest if you had borrowed money to acquire the dwelling. If you run a business or professional practice in part of your home, you would be entitled to deduct part of the interest on money you borrowed to acquire the dwelling if: part of the dwelling is set aside exclusively as a place of business and is clearly identifiable as such, and that part of the home is not readily adaptable for private use, for example, a doctor\u2019s surgery located within the doctor\u2019s home.

If you run a business or professional practice in part of your home, you would be entitled to deduct part of the interest on money you borrowed to acquire the dwelling if: part of the dwelling is set aside exclusively as a place of business and is clearly identifiable as such, and that part of the home is not readily adaptable for private use, for example, a doctor\u2019s surgery located within the doctor\u2019s home. You would not be entitled to deduct any interest expenses if, for convenience, you use a home study to undertake work usually done at your place of work. Similarly, you would not be entitled to deduct interest expenses if you do paid child-minding at home (unless a special part of the home was set aside exclusively for that purpose). In these situations, you could still get a full main residence exemption. Example 68: Renting out part of a home Thomas purchased a home under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0July 1999 and sold it under a contract that was settled on 30\u00a0June 2023. The home was his main residence for the entire time. Throughout the period Thomas owned the home, a tenant rented one bedroom, which represented 20% of the home. Both Thomas and the tenant used the living room, bathroom, laundry and kitchen, which represented 30% of the home. Only Thomas used the remainder of the home. Therefore, Thomas would be entitled to a 35% deduction for interest if he had incurred it on money borrowed to acquire his home. The home first used to produce income rule does not apply because Thomas used the home to produce income from the date he purchased it. Thomas made a capital gain of $120,000 when he sold the home. Of this total gain, the following proportion is not exempt: Capital gain \u00d7 percentage of floor area = taxable portion $120,000 \u00d7 35% = $42,000 As Thomas entered into the contract to acquire the home before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999, and entered into the contract to sell it after he had held it for at least 12\u00a0months, he can use either the indexation or the discount method to calculate his capital gain. End of example If you set aside and use part of the dwelling exclusively as a place of business, you cannot get a CGT exemption for that part of the dwelling by not claiming a deduction for the interest. Nor can you include interest in the cost base if you are entitled to a deduction but do not claim it. You can still get a full main residence exemption if someone else uses part of your home to produce income and you receive no income from that person. When a CGT event happens to the home, the proportion of the capital gain or capital loss that is taxable is an amount that is reasonable according to the extent to which you would have been able to deduct the interest on money borrowed to acquire the home. In most cases, this is the proportion of the floor area of the home that is set aside to produce income and the period you use the home to produce income. This includes if the dwelling is available (for example, advertised) for rent. Example 69: Running a business in part of a home for part of the period of ownership Ruth entered into a contract to buy her home that settled before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999. Ruth owned the home for more than 12\u00a0months. The home was her main residence for the entire period she owned it. For half the period Ruth owned the home, she used part of the home to operate her photographic business. She modified the rooms for that purpose and they were no longer suitable for private and domestic use. They represented 25% of the total floor area of the home.

End of example For more information, see Rental properties 2023 . Home first used to produce income If you start using part or all of your main residence to produce income for the first time after 20\u00a0August 1996, a special rule affects the way you calculate your capital gain or capital loss. In this case, you are taken to have acquired the dwelling at its market value at the time you first used it to produce income if all of the following apply: you acquired the dwelling on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 you first used the dwelling to produce income after 20\u00a0August 1996 when a CGT event happens to the dwelling, you would get only a partial exemption, because you used the dwelling to produce assessable income during the period you owned it you would have been entitled to a full exemption if the CGT event happened to the dwelling immediately before you first used it to produce income. If all of the above apply, you must work out your capital gain or capital loss using the market value of the dwelling at the time you first used it to produce income. You do not have a choice. A similar rule applies if you inherit a dwelling that was the deceased\u2019s main residence and you use it to produce income, see Using a home you inherited to produce income . Full exemption You may have made the choice to treat a dwelling as your main residence after the dwelling ceases to be your main residence, see Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence . In this case, if the dwelling is fully exempt, the \u2018home first used to produce income\u2019 rule does not apply. In working out the amount of capital gain or capital loss, the period before the dwelling is first used by you to produce income is not taken into account. The extent of the exemption depends on the period after that time and the proportion of the home used to produce income. The following 3 examples explain this. If the \u2018home first used to produce income\u2019 rule applies and the period between when you first used the dwelling to produce income and the CGT event happening is less than 12\u00a0months, the CGT discount method is not available.

At that time, the market value of the old home was $450,000. Erin does not want to treat the old home as her main residence, see Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence , as she wants the new home to be treated as her main residence from when she moved into it.

On 1\u00a0November 2021, she started to use 50% of the home for a consultancy business. At that time the market value of the house was $320,000. She decided to sell the property in August 2022 for $350,000. As Louise was still living in the home, she could not get a full exemption under the continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence rule. The capital gain is 50% of the proceeds less the cost base. Percentage of use \u00d7 (proceeds \u2212 cost base) = capital gain 50% \u00d7 ($350,000 \u2212 $320,000) = $15,000 Louise is taken to have acquired the property on 1\u00a0November 2021 at a cost of $320,000. Because she is taken to have acquired it at this time, Louise is taken to have owned it for less than 12\u00a0months and must use the 'other' method to calculate her capital gain. End of example If you make the choice to continue to treat a dwelling as your main residence after it ceases to be your main residence (see Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence ) and you do not get a full exemption, the \u2018home first used to produce income\u2019 rule may apply. Example 72: Dwelling used to produce income for more than 6\u00a0years and first used to produce income after 20\u00a0August 1996 Roya purchased an apartment in Australia for $280,000 under a contract that was settled on 15\u00a0September 1994, and immediately started using the apartment as her main residence. On 29\u00a0September 1996, she moved overseas and began renting out the apartment. During the time she was overseas, she did not acquire another dwelling and continued to rent out the apartment. After she returned to Australia in July 2022, she sold the apartment for $555,000.

End of example Moving from one main residence to another If you acquire a new home before you dispose of your old one, both dwellings are treated as your main residence for up to 6 months if: the old dwelling was your main residence for a continuous period of at least 3 months in the 12\u00a0months before you disposed of it you did not use the old dwelling to produce assessable income in any part of that 12\u00a0months when it was not your main residence, and the new dwelling becomes your main residence. If you dispose of the old dwelling within 6 months of acquiring the new one, both dwellings are exempt for the whole period between when you acquire the new one and dispose of the old one. Example 73: Exemption for both homes Jill and Norman bought their new home under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0January 2023 and they moved in immediately. They sold their old home under a contract that was settled on 15\u00a0April 2023. Both the old and new homes are treated as their main residence for the period 1\u00a0January to 15\u00a0April, even though they did not live in the old home during that period. End of example If it takes longer than 6 months to dispose of your old home, both homes are exempt only for the last 6 months before you dispose of the old one. You get only a partial exemption when a CGT event happens to your old home. Example 74: Partial exemption for old home Jeneen and John bought their home under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0January 1999 and they moved in immediately. It was their main residence until they bought another home under a contract that was entered into on 2\u00a0November 2021 and settled on 1\u00a0January 2022. They retained their old home after moving into the new one on 1\u00a0January 2022, but did not use the old one to produce income. They sold the old home under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0October 2022. They owned this home for a total period of 8,675 days. Both homes are treated as their main residence for the period 1\u00a0April 2022 to 1\u00a0October 2022, the last 6 months that Jeneen and John owned their old home. Therefore, their old home is treated as their main residence only for the period before settlement of their new home and during the last 6 months before settlement of the sale of the old home. The 90 days from 1\u00a0January 2022 to 31\u00a0March 2022, when the old home was not their main residence, are taken into account in calculating the proportion of their capital gain that is taxable (90\u00a0\u00f7\u00a08,675).", "start_char_idx": 65604, "end_char_idx": 69403, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "174305be-622e-43b0-93f7-06c5e824b3f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "174305be-622e-43b0-93f7-06c5e824b3f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cce505b5-f75a-4f8d-8416-22207decc5e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "31e87b1391dce956008d679e583378261fbd54ab17db10a86f6d8b13c2647d2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8934cb19-2797-487f-ac0a-dd7a50ee74bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_name": "real-estate-and-main-residence?anchor=Real_estate_and_main_residence#Real_estate_and_main_residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 125919, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "5e2a508770c4c00fdf4ebb6ddb87fb4fe6b821f84ba223837b953d4790e3ea47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "247c32a5-0db4-4be1-add9-4fb6886a51b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01b7bc0622c7b031b4c4f82157611c8e91fc098f1f2b1536996d7ae64755b3d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3f5e35e73637b09bcf7184c77665647e7915848a3ac99331b59d07830758b80a", "text": "They sold the old home under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0October 2022.

End of example If it takes longer than 6 months to dispose of your old home, you may get an exemption for the old home for the period in excess of the 6 months by choosing to treat it as your main residence for that period under the \u2018continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence\u2019 rule. If you do this, you get only a partial exemption when you dispose of your new home. Example 75: Partial exemption for new home The facts are the same as in the previous example, except that Jeneen and John choose to continue to treat their old home as their main residence for the period from 1\u00a0January 2022 to 31\u00a0March 2022 under the continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence rule. This means they get a full exemption when they sell it. Because both homes can only be exempt for a maximum of 6 months when you are moving from one to the other, Jeneen and John will not get a full exemption for their new home when they sell it. The exemption would not be available for the new home for the 90\u00a0days from 1\u00a0January 2022 to 31\u00a0March 2022. End of example Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence In some cases, you can choose to treat a dwelling as your main residence even though you no longer live in it. You cannot make this choice for a period before a dwelling first becomes your main residence. See Is the dwelling your main residence? Example 76: Not main residence until you move in Therese bought a house and rented it out immediately. Later, she stopped renting it out and moved in. Therese cannot choose to treat the house as her main residence during the period she was absent under the continuing main residence rule, because the house was not her main residence before she rented it out. She will only be entitled to a partial exemption if she sells the dwelling. End of example This choice needs to be made only for the income year that the CGT event happens to the dwelling, for example, the year that you enter into a contract to sell it. If you own both: the dwelling that you can choose to treat as your main residence after you no longer live in it, and the dwelling you actually lived in during that period you make the choice for the income year you enter into the contract to sell the first of those dwellings. If you make this choice, you cannot treat any other dwelling as your main residence for that period (except for a limited time if you are changing main residences, see Moving from one main residence to another ). If you do not use it to produce income (for example, you leave it vacant or use it as a holiday home) you can treat the dwelling as your main residence for an unlimited period after you stop living in it. If you do use it to produce income (for example, you rent it out or it is available for rent) you can choose to treat it as your main residence for up to 6 years after you stop living in it (see example\u00a072 ). If you make this choice and as a result of it the dwelling is fully exempt, the home first used to produce income rule does not apply.

Example 77: One period of absence of 10 years Lisa bought a house after 20\u00a0September 1985 but stopped using it as her main residence for the 10\u00a0years immediately before she sold it. During this period, she rented it out for 6 years and left it vacant for 4 years. Lisa chooses to treat the dwelling as her main residence for the period after she stopped living in it, so she disregards any capital gain or capital loss she makes on the sale of the dwelling. The maximum period the dwelling can continue to be her main residence while she used it to produce income is 6 years. However, while the house is vacant, the period she can treat the dwelling as her main residence is unlimited. This means the exemption applies for the whole 10\u00a0years that she was absent from the dwelling. As the dwelling is fully exempt because Lisa made the choice to treat the dwelling as her main residence, the home first used to produce income rule does not apply. The maximum period that Lisa can treat the dwelling as her main residence whilst it was being used to produce income is a total of 6 years even if the period the dwelling was income producing was broken by a period of vacancy. For example, if Lisa rented the dwelling for 4 years, left it vacant for 3 years and rented for 3 years, she could only treat the dwelling as her main residence for 9 of the 10\u00a0years that she was not living there. End of example You can choose when you want to stop the period covered by this choice. For information on when and how you make a choice, see Choices . Example 78: Choosing to stop the period covered by the choice early James bought his home in Brisbane on 1\u00a0July 2002 and moved in immediately. On 31\u00a0July 2015, he moved to Perth and rented out his Brisbane home. James bought a new residence in Perth on 31\u00a0January 2022. He sold the property in Brisbane on 31\u00a0July 2022. In completing his 2023 tax return, James decided to continue to treat the Brisbane property as his main residence after he moved out of it, but only until 31\u00a0January 2022, when he purchased his new main residence in Perth. End of example If you rent out the dwelling for more than 6 years, the \u2018home first used to produce income\u2019 rule may apply, which means you are taken to have acquired the dwelling at its market value at the time you first used it to produce income. See Home first used to produce income . If you are absent more than once during the period you own the home, the 6-year maximum period that you can treat it as your main residence while you use it to produce income applies separately to each period of absence. Example 79: 2 periods of absence of 8 years Lana bought a house after 20\u00a0September 1985. For the last 20\u00a0years prior to selling the house she stopped using it as her main residence for 2 periods of 8 years. During each period, she rented it out for 6 years and left it vacant for 2 years. Between the first and second period of absence she lived in the dwelling for 2 years. She sold it 2 years after last returning to live in the house. Lana chooses to treat the dwelling as her main residence for the periods after she stopped living in it.

The tenant left his Sydney home, and Ian decided to leave it vacant. The period of 5 years from 1995 to 1999 is the first period the Sydney home was used to produce income for the purpose of the 6-year test. 1\u00a0January 2000 Ian was posted from Brisbane to Melbourne for 3 years and settled a contract to buy a home in Melbourne. He did not return to his Sydney home at this time. 1\u00a0March 2000 Ian again rented out his Sydney home, this time for 2 years. 28\u00a0February 2002 The tenant of his Sydney home left, and Ian again chose to leave it vacant.

End of example Constructing, renovating or repairing a dwelling on land you already own Generally, if you build a dwelling on land you already own, the land does not qualify for exemption until the dwelling becomes your main residence. However, you can choose to treat land as your main residence for up to 4 years, or a longer time if allowed by the Commissioner, before the dwelling becomes your main residence in certain circumstances. You can choose to have this exemption apply if you acquire an ownership interest (other than a life interest) in land and you: build a dwelling on the land repair or renovate an existing dwelling on the land, or finish a partly constructed dwelling on the land. There are conditions that you must satisfy before you can claim the exemption. You must first finish building, repairing or renovating the dwelling and then: move into the dwelling as soon as practicable after it is finished continue to use the dwelling as your main residence for at least 3\u00a0months after it becomes your main residence. A period in which you choose to treat a dwelling as your main residence under the continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence rule is taken into account in working out the 3\u00a0month period. The land, including the dwelling that is being built, renovated, repaired or finished on it, is exempt for the shorter of the following periods: the 4-year period, or a longer time if allowed by the Commissioner, immediately before the date the dwelling becomes your main residence the period between the date you acquired the land and the date the dwelling becomes your main residence. However, if after you acquired the land you or someone else occupied a dwelling that was already on the land, the period of exemption starts from the date that dwelling was vacated. Full exemption If a newly constructed dwelling is built to replace a previous dwelling that was demolished or destroyed, you can get a full exemption when you dispose of the property if: the original dwelling was your main residence for the full period you owned it, you did not use it to produce assessable income, and it was on land covering an area of 2 hectares or less the new dwelling becomes your main residence as soon as practicable after it is completed, it continues to be your main residence until you dispose of it, and that period is at least 3 months you make a choice to treat the vacant land and new dwelling as your main residence in the period starting when you stopped occupying the previous dwelling and ending when the new dwelling becomes your main residence, and this period is 4 years, or a longer period if allowed by the Commissioner, or less you dispose of the land and new dwelling together. The Commissioner will consider extending the 4-year period if the delay in building or renovating the dwelling was: beyond your control, for example the builder becomes bankrupt and is unable to complete the building or renovation. caused by unforeseen circumstances such as illness or injury to the you or a family member that caused the work to be stopped. If you make this choice, you cannot treat any other dwelling as your main residence for the period, except for a limited time under the moving from one main residence to another rule.

If you acquired your old main residence before 20\u00a0September 1985, it is fully exempt. (The exception is if you made major capital improvements after that date and did not use them exclusively as your main residence; see Major capital improvements to a dwelling acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 ).This means you will benefit from choosing to treat the land on which your new dwelling is to be built, renovated, repaired or finished as your main residence for the relevant dates above. You cannot choose to have a shorter period of exemption for the new home in order to exempt the old home for part of the construction period. For information on when and how you make a choice, see Choices . Example 82: Choosing to claim exemption for the land from the date of construction Grant bought vacant land on which he intended to build a new home under a contract that was settled on 3\u00a0September 2007. He bought his previous home under a contract that was settled on 3\u00a0November 1994. Grant finished building his new home on 3\u00a0September 2022. He moved into it on 7\u00a0October 2022, which was as soon as practicable after completion. He sold his previous home under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0October 2022. Grant can treat the new home as his main residence from 7\u00a0October 2018. In these circumstances, the main residence exemption applies for the period of 4 years immediately before the date the new home actually becomes his main residence. He can also claim the exemption for his previous home from 3\u00a0November 1994 to 6\u00a0October 2018. Both homes are also exempt from 1\u00a0April 2022 to 1\u00a0October 2022, the date Grant disposed of the old home. This is because the maximum 6-month exemption also applies, see Moving from one main residence to another . End of example If you were to die at any time between entering into contracts for the construction work and the end of the first 3 months of residence in the new home, this exemption can still apply. If you owned the land as a joint tenant and you die, the surviving joint tenant (or if none, the trustee of your estate) can choose to treat the land and the dwelling as your main residence for the shorter of: 4 years before your death, or the period starting when you acquired the land and ending when you die. If there was already a dwelling on the land when you acquired it and someone else occupied it after that time, the surviving joint tenant (or if none, the trustee of your estate) can choose to treat the land and the dwelling as your main residence for the shorter of: 4 years before your death, or the period starting when the dwelling stopped being occupied so that it could be repaired or renovated and ending when you die. If you are a surviving joint tenant, beneficiary or trustee of a deceased estate and a CGT event happens to your residential property in Australia that you inherited from a foreign resident, you will no longer be entitled to claim the main residence exemption for the deceased\u2019s ownership period unless certain life events occurred within a continuous period of 6 years of the deceased individual becoming a foreign resident for tax purposes.

Partial exemption If a newly constructed dwelling is built to replace an original dwelling that was demolished or destroyed more than 4 years before the new dwelling became your main residence and the Commissioner does not allow a longer period, you may be entitled to a partial exemption. You can get a partial exemption covering the period from 4 years prior to the date the new dwelling became your main residence if: the original dwelling was your main residence for the full period you owned it, you did not use it to produce assessable income, and it was on land covering an area of 2 hectares or less the new dwelling becomes your main residence as soon as practicable after it is completed, it continues to be your main residence until you dispose of it, and that period is at least 3 months you make a choice to treat the vacant land and new dwelling as your main residence in the period of up to 4 years before the new dwelling becomes your main residence you dispose of the land and new dwelling together. As more than 4 years has elapsed, no exemption is available from the start of the original ownership period to the time when the original dwelling was vacated even though the original dwelling was the taxpayer\u2019s main residence throughout that time. If you do not make the choice, an exemption will only be available from the time the new dwelling became your main residence. A partial exemption will also be available on the sale of a newly constructed dwelling built to replace a previous residence which was not your main residence for the whole time you owned it. For example, where you had rented out your property during the original ownership period, and you treated another dwelling as your main residence during that time. Destruction of dwelling and sale of land If your home is accidentally destroyed (such as through a natural disaster) and you then dispose of the vacant land on which it was built, you can choose to apply the main residence exemption as if the home had not been destroyed and continued to be your main residence. You can get a full exemption for the land if you used it solely for private purposes in association with your home and it does not exceed 2 hectares. You cannot claim the main residence exemption for this period for any other dwelling, except for a limited time if you are changing main residences, see Moving from one main residence to another . You can only get this exemption where your home was accidentally destroyed. If the destruction of your home is intentional and just after the destruction you sell the vacant block of land, you cannot get the main residence exemption. Having a different home from your spouse or dependent child If you and a dependent child under 18\u00a0years old have different homes for a period, you must choose one of the homes as the main residence for both of you for the period. If you and your spouse have different homes for a period, you and your spouse must either: choose one of the homes as the main residence for both of you for the period, or nominate the different homes as your main residences for the period. If you and your spouse nominate different homes for the period, and you own 50% or less of the home you have nominated, you qualify for an exemption for your share. If you own more than 50%, your share is exempt for half the period you and your spouse had different homes. The same applies to your spouse. If your spouse owns 50% or less of the home they have nominated, they qualify for an exemption for their share. However, if your spouse owns more than 50% of the home, their share is exempt for only half the period you had different homes. This rule applies to each home the spouses own, whether they have sole ownership or own the home jointly (either as joint tenants or tenants in common). Your 'spouse' includes another person (of any sex) who: you were in a relationship with that was registered under a prescribed state or territory law although not legally married to you, lived with you on a genuine domestic basis in a relationship as a couple.

Example 83: Spouses with different main residences Under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0July 1998, Kathy and her spouse Grahame purchased a townhouse, in which they lived together. Grahame owns 70% of the townhouse while Kathy owns the other 30%. Under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0August 2000, they purchased a beach house, which they own in equal shares. From 1\u00a0May 2001, Kathy lives in their beach house while Grahame keeps living in the townhouse. Grahame nominated the townhouse as his main residence and Kathy nominated the beach house as her main residence. Kathy and Grahame sold the beach house under a contract that was settled on 15\u00a0April 2023. As it was Kathy\u2019s main residence and she owned 50% of it, she disregards her share of any capital gain or capital loss for the period she and Grahame had different homes (1\u00a0May 2001 to 15\u00a0April 2023). As Grahame did not live in the beach house or nominate it as his main residence when he and Kathy had different homes, he does not ignore his share of any capital gain or capital loss for any of the period he owned it. Grahame and Kathy also sold the townhouse, under a contract that was settled on 15\u00a0April 2023. Because Grahame owns more than 50% of the townhouse, it is taken to have been his main residence for half of the period when he and Kathy had different homes. If the total capital gain on the sale of the townhouse is $100,000, Grahame\u2019s share of the capital gain is $70,000 (reflecting his 70% ownership interest).

End of example Example 84: Different main residences Anna and her spouse, Mark, jointly purchased a townhouse under a contract that was settled on 5\u00a0February 1999. They both lived in it from that date until 29\u00a0April 2023, when the contract of sale was settled. Anna owned more than 50% of the townhouse. Before 5 February 1999, Anna had lived alone in her own flat, which she rented out after moving to the townhouse. She then sold her flat and settled the sale on 11\u00a0March 2000. Anna chose to treat the flat as her main residence from 5\u00a0February 1999 until she sold it under the continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence rule. Because of Anna\u2019s choice, Mark had a different main residence from Anna for the period 5\u00a0February 1999 to 11\u00a0March 2000. Therefore, Mark must either: treat Anna\u2019s flat as his main residence for that period, or nominate the townhouse as his main residence for that period. If he chooses to treat Anna\u2019s flat as his main residence, a part of any gain Mark makes when he sells the townhouse will be taxable. He will not get an exemption for the townhouse for the period that he nominated Anna\u2019s flat as his main residence (that is, 5\u00a0February 1999 to 11\u00a0March 2000). If Mark nominates the townhouse as his main residence, he qualifies for a full exemption on any capital gain he makes when it is sold because he owned 50% or less of it. However, because Mark and Anna have different main residences as a result of Mark\u2019s choice, and Anna owns more than 50% of the flat, her gain on the flat will only qualify for a 50% exemption for the period from 5\u00a0February 1999 to 11\u00a0March 2000. Any capital gain Anna makes on the townhouse is taxable, except for the period from 12\u00a0March 2000 to 29\u00a0April 2023 and the part that is ignored under the moving from one main residence to another rule. End of example Major capital improvements to a dwelling acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 If you acquired a dwelling before 20\u00a0September 1985 and you make major capital improvements after that date, part of any capital gain you make when a CGT event happens to the dwelling could be taxable. Even though you acquired the dwelling before CGT started, major capital improvements are considered to be separate CGT assets from the original asset, and may therefore be subject to CGT in their own right if you make them on or after 20\u00a0September 1985. If the dwelling is your main residence and you use the improvements as part of your home, they are still exempt. This includes improvements on land adjacent to the dwelling (for example, installing a swimming pool) if the total land, including the land on which the home stands, is 2 hectares or less. However, if the dwelling is not your main residence or you used the improvements to produce income for any period, the part of any gain that is attributable to the improvements for that period is taxable. A capital improvement to an existing structure, such as a renovation to your house, is taken to be major if its original cost (indexed for inflation if the improvements were made under a contract entered into before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999) is: more than 5% of the amount you receive when you dispose of the dwelling, and greater than a certain threshold.

The threshold increases every income year to take account of inflation. Improvement thresholds for 1985\u201386 to 2022\u201323 are shown in table\u00a01 . When you dispose of the dwelling, you calculate the capital gain or capital loss on the major improvements by taking away the cost base of the improvements from the proceeds of the sale that are reasonably attributable to the improvements: A = B \u2212 C Where: A is capital gain on major improvements B is proceeds of sale attributable to improvements C is cost base of improvements You can choose to calculate the capital gain made on the improvements using either the indexation or the discount method if: the improvements were made under a contract entered into at or before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999 the dwelling was sold after that time, and you owned the improvements for at least 12\u00a0months. If you entered into the contract to make the improvements after 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999 and you owned them for more than 12\u00a0months, you can calculate your capital gain using the CGT discount of 50%. In calculating the amount of capital proceeds to be attributed to the improvements, you must take whatever steps are appropriate to work out their value. If you make an estimate of this amount, it must be reasonable and you must be able to show how you arrived at the estimated amount. Example 85: Improvement to a dwelling acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 Martin bought a home in 1984. On 1\u00a0December 1993, he undertook major renovations to his home, costing $150,000. He sold the home for $500,000 under a contract that was settled on 1\u00a0December 2022. At the date of sale, the indexed cost base of the improvements was $168,450. Of the $500,000 he received for the home, $200,000 could be attributed to the improvements. Martin used the improvements to produce income from the time they were finished until the time he sold them with the home. The home first used to produce income rule does not apply to the improvements because they were first used to produce income before 21\u00a0August 1996. The cost base of the improvements is more than 5% of the $500,000 capital proceeds (that is, $25,000) and more than the 2022\u201323 threshold of $162,899. Therefore, because the improvements were used to produce income, the capital gain on the improvements is taxable. (Because the improvements were made under a contract entered into before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999 the indexed cost base can be used.) As Martin acquired the improvements before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999 and sold the home after he had held the improvements for at least 12\u00a0months, he could use either the indexation method or the discount method to calculate his capital gain on the improvements. Martin calculates his capital gain using the indexation method as follows: Amount of proceeds attributable to the improvements $200,000 less cost base of improvements indexed for inflation $168,450 Taxable capital gain $31,550 Martin\u2019s capital gain using the discount method (assuming he has no capital losses or other capital gains in the 2022\u201323 income year and does not have any unapplied net capital losses from earlier years) is: Amount of proceeds attributable to the improvements $200,000 less cost base of improvements (without indexation) $150,000 Capital gain $50,000 less 50% discount $25,000 Net capital gain $25,000 Martin chooses the discount method because this gives him a lower capital gain.

Note: If the improvements had been used as part of Martin\u2019s main residence, this gain would be exempt. However, if the home (including the improvements) had been rented out for one-third of the period, one-third of the capital gain made on the improvements would have been taxable. If construction of the improvements started after 13\u00a0May 1997 and they were used to produce income, Martin would also reduce the cost base by the amount of any capital works deductions he claimed or can claim, see Cost base adjustments for capital works deductions .

End of example Buildings or structures constructed on land acquired before 20\u00a0September 1985 Buildings or structures constructed on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 on land acquired before that date are also considered to be separate CGT assets from the original land. The major capital improvement threshold and 5% of capital proceeds rules do not apply to them. Therefore, they may be subject to CGT if you use them other than as your main residence. Dwellings transferred after marriage or relationship breakdown Special rules apply to dwellings transferred to you from a spouse, or a company or trustee of a trust, if the marriage or relationship breakdown rollover applies. For more information, see Real estate and main residence . Inherited main residence If you inherit a deceased person\u2019s dwelling, you may be exempt or partially exempt when a CGT event happens to it. The same exemptions apply if a CGT event happens to a deceased\u2019s estate of which you are the trustee. Flowchart\u00a03.6 in appendix\u00a03 sets out the full exemption rules if you inherit a dwelling. Alternatively, the rules are set out below. If you are a joint tenant and another joint tenant dies, their interest in the dwelling is taken to pass in equal shares to you and any other surviving joint tenants on that date. For the purpose of the main residence exemption, you are treated as if that interest in the dwelling has passed to you as beneficiary of the deceased estate, which means the following rules apply to that interest. If you are a surviving joint tenant, beneficiary or trustee of a deceased estate and a CGT event happens to your residential property in Australia that you inherited from a foreign resident, you may no longer be entitled to claim the main residence exemption for the deceased\u2019s ownership period, depending on the length of time the deceased had been a foreign resident. If you inherit an Australian residential property from a deceased person who had been a foreign resident for 6 years or less at the time of their death, the main residence exemption that the deceased accrued for the dwelling is available to you as the beneficiary. The main residence exemption means you may not pay CGT on any capital gain made after you sell or dispose of the inherited property, depending on the use of the property by both you and the deceased. If you inherit an Australian residential property from a deceased person who had been a foreign resident for more than 6 years at the time of their death, any main residence exemption that the deceased person may have accrued for that dwelling is not available to you. This means you may have to pay CGT when you sell or dispose of the property.

Deceased died on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 A . The deceased acquired the dwelling before 20\u00a0September 1985 (it does not matter whether the dwelling was the main residence of the deceased person). You may have an ownership interest in a dwelling that passed to you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate or you may have owned it as trustee of a deceased estate. In either case, you disregard any capital gain or capital loss you make from a CGT event that happens to the dwelling if either of the following 2 conditions applies. You disposed of your ownership interest within 2 years of the person\u2019s death, that is, if the dwelling was sold under a contract, settlement occurred within 2 years. This exemption applies whether or not you used the dwelling as your main residence or to produce income during the 2-year period. The Commissioner has the discretion to extend the 2-year period for CGT events (such as a sale) happening in the 2008\u201309 income year and later years, see Commissioner may extend the 2-year time period . From the deceased\u2019s death until you disposed of your ownership interest, the dwelling was not used to produce income and was the main residence of one or more of a person who was the spouse of the deceased immediately before the deceased\u2019s death (but not a spouse who was permanently separated from the deceased) an individual who had a right to occupy the home under the deceased's will (including a right to occupy the home as a result of a court order under the relevant family provision legislation that takes effect as if it had been made as a codicil to the deceased's will) you, as a beneficiary, if you disposed of the dwelling as a beneficiary. The dwelling can be the main residence of one of the above people (even though they may have stopped living in it) if they choose to treat it as their main residence under the continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence rule. The requirement that the dwelling is the main residence of an individual who had a right to occupy it under the deceased\u2019s will is satisfied if the individual moves into the dwelling when it is first practicable to do so. This requirement will be satisfied where the delay in moving is because the dwelling cannot be occupied until probate and administration of the estate is granted. B .

Condition 2 in A above is met and the dwelling passed to you as beneficiary or trustee on or before 20\u00a0August 1996. For this to apply, the deceased must have used the dwelling as their main residence from the date they acquired it until their death, and they must not have used it to produce income.

End of example Partial exemption If you do not qualify for a full exemption from CGT for the home, you may be entitled to a partial exemption. You calculate your capital gain or capital loss as follows: Capital gain or capital loss amount \u00d7 (non-main residence days \u00f7 total days) Non-main residence days \u2018Non-main residence days\u2019 is the number of days that the dwelling was not the main residence. If the deceased acquired the dwelling before 20\u00a0September 1985, non-main residence days is the number of days in the period from their death until settlement of your contract for sale of the dwelling when it was not the main residence of one of the following a person who was the spouse of the deceased (except a spouse who was permanently separated from the deceased) an individual who had a right to occupy the dwelling under the deceased\u2019s will, or you, as a beneficiary, if you disposed of the dwelling as a beneficiary. Total days If the deceased acquired their ownership interest before 20\u00a0September 1985, \u2018total days\u2019 is the number of days from their death until you disposed of your ownership interest. If the deceased acquired the ownership interest on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, total days is the number of days in the period from when the deceased acquired the dwelling until you disposed of your ownership interest. A further adjustment may be required if the dwelling was a main residence, but was partly used to produce income, for example, if, for a period, part of it was rented out or used as a place of business. Example 87: Partial exemption Vicki bought a house under a contract that was settled on 12\u00a0February 1995 and she used it solely as a rental property. When she died on 17\u00a0November 1998, the house became the main residence of her beneficiary, Lesley. Lesley sold the property under a contract that was settled on 27\u00a0November 2022. As Vicki had never used the property as her main residence, Lesley cannot claim a full exemption from CGT. However, as Lesley used the house as her main residence, she is entitled to a partial exemption from CGT. Vicki owned the house for 1,375 days and Lesley then lived in the house for 8,776 days, a total of 10,151 days. Assuming Lesley made a capital gain of $100,000, the taxable portion is: $100,000 \u00d7 (1,375 \u00f7 10,151) = $13,545 In working out her capital gain, Lesley can use either the discount method or the indexation method. This is because, for the purposes of using those methods, she is taken to have acquired the property on 12\u00a0February 1995 (when Vicki acquired it) and this is before 11:45\u00a0am AEST on 21\u00a0September 1999, and more than 12\u00a0months before Lesley entered into the contract to sell it. End of example If you dispose of your ownership interest in a dwelling within 2 years of the person\u2019s death, you can ignore the main residence days and total days in the period from the person\u2019s death until you dispose of the dwelling if this lessens your tax liability.

See Commissioner may extend the 2-year time period . You also ignore any non-main residence days before the deceased\u2019s death in calculating the capital gain or capital loss if: you acquired the dwelling after 20\u00a0August 1996 the dwelling was the deceased\u2019s main residence just before their death the dwelling was not being used to produce income at the time of their death, and the deceased was not a foreign resident for a continuous period of more than 6 years just before the deceased's death. Using a home you inherited to produce income If a person acquired their main residence on or after 20\u00a0September 1985, and they died and it passed to you as a beneficiary (or as trustee of their estate) after 20\u00a0August 1996, you are taken to have acquired the dwelling at its market value at the time you first used it to produce your income if: you first used the dwelling to produce income after 20\u00a0August 1996 when a CGT event happens to the dwelling, you would get only a partial exemption because you used the dwelling to produce assessable income during the period you owned it you would have been entitled to a full exemption if the CGT event happened to the dwelling immediately before you first used it to produce income the CGT event did not happen to the dwelling within 2 years of the person\u2019s date of death. If all of the above apply, you must work out your capital gain or capital loss using the market value of the dwelling at the time you first used it to produce income. You do not have a choice. Cost to you of acquiring the dwelling If you acquire a dwelling the deceased had owned, there are special rules for calculating your cost base. These rules apply in calculating any capital gain or capital loss when a CGT event happens to the dwelling. The first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of a dwelling (its acquisition cost) is its market value at the date of death if either: the dwelling was acquired by the deceased before 20\u00a0September 1985, or the dwelling passes to you after 20\u00a0August 1996 (but not as a joint tenant), and it was the main residence of the deceased immediately before their death and was not being used to produce income at that date. In any other case, your acquisition cost is the deceased\u2019s cost base and reduced cost base on the day they died. You may need to contact the trustee or the deceased\u2019s recognised tax adviser to obtain the details. If that cost base includes indexation, you must recalculate it to exclude the indexation component if you prefer to use the discount method to work out your capital gain from the property. If you are a beneficiary, the cost base and the reduced cost base also include amounts that the trustee of the deceased\u2019s estate would have been able to include in the cost base and reduced cost base. Continuing main residence status If the deceased was not living in the home at the date of their death, they or their trustee may have chosen to continue to treat it as their main residence. You may need to contact the trustee or the deceased\u2019s recognised tax adviser to find out whether this choice was made. If it was, the dwelling can still be regarded as the deceased\u2019s main residence: for an indefinite period, if the dwelling was not used to produce income after the deceased stopped living in it, or for a maximum of 6 years after they stopped living in it, if it was used to produce income after they stopped living in it.

If it was, the dwelling can still be regarded as the deceased\u2019s main residence: for an indefinite period, if the dwelling was not used to produce income after the deceased stopped living in it, or for a maximum of 6 years after they stopped living in it, if it was used to produce income after they stopped living in it. Example 88: Continuing main residence status Aldo bought a house in March 1995 and lived in it. He moved into a nursing home in December 2017 and left the house vacant. He chose to treat the house as his main residence after he stopped living in it under the Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence rule. Aldo died in February 2023 and the house passed to his beneficiary, Con, who uses the house as a rental property. As the house was Aldo\u2019s main residence immediately before his death and was not being used to produce income at that time, Con can get a full exemption for the period Aldo owned it. If Con rented out the house and sold it more than 2 years after Aldo\u2019s death, the capital gain for the period from the date of Aldo\u2019s death until Con sold it is taxable, unless the Commissioner grants Con an extension of time, see Commissioner may extend the 2-year time period . If Con had sold the house within 2 years of Aldo\u2019s death, he could have ignored the main residence days and total days between Aldo\u2019s death and him selling it, which would have given him exemption for this period. If Aldo had rented out the house after he stopped living in it, he could also have chosen to continue to treat it as his main residence, see Continuing main residence status after dwelling ceases to be your main residence . The house would be considered to be his main residence until his death because he rented it out for less than 6 years. If this choice had been made, Con would get an exemption for the period Aldo owned the house. End of example Commissioner may extend the 2-year time period A trustee or beneficiary of a deceased estate may apply to the Commissioner for an extension of the 2-year time period , where the CGT event happened in 2008\u201309 or later. Generally, the Commissioner would exercise the discretion in situations where the delay is due to circumstances which are outside of the control of the beneficiary or trustee, for example: the ownership of a dwelling or a will is challenged the complexity of a deceased estate delays the completion of administration of the estate a trustee or beneficiary is unable to attend to the deceased estate due to unforeseen or serious personal circumstances arising during the 2-year period (for example, the taxpayer or a family member has a severe illness or injury), or settlement of a contract of sale over the dwelling is unexpectedly delayed or falls through for circumstances outside the beneficiary or trustee\u2019s control. These examples are not exhaustive. In exercising the discretion, the Commissioner will also take into account whether and to what extent the dwelling is used to produce assessable income and for how long the trustee or beneficiary held the ownership interest in the dwelling. In certain circumstances you may be eligible to use the safe harbour to extend the 2\u2013year period without having to apply to the Commissioner to exercise discretion. For more information, see Extensions to the 2-year ownership period . Inheriting a dwelling from someone who inherited it themselves The formula for calculating the partial main residence exemption is adjusted if the deceased individual also acquired the interest in the dwelling on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 as a beneficiary (or trustee) of a deceased estate. The main residence exemption is calculated having regard to the number of days the dwelling was the main residence of yourself and the previous beneficiaries. Example 89: Partial exemption for beneficiaries Ahmed acquired a dwelling after 20\u00a0September 1985. The dwelling was his main residence from the date of settlement of the contract for purchase until he died. The number of days Ahmed owned the dwelling was 3,700. Under his will, Ahmed left the dwelling to his son, Fayez. Fayez was the sole beneficiary of Ahmed\u2019s estate. No other individual had a right to occupy the dwelling under Ahmed\u2019s will. Some years later, Fayez died. He had owned the dwelling for 2,600 days and it wasn\u2019t his main residence at any time during this period.

She owned the dwelling for 750 days and it wasn\u2019t her main residence at any time during that period. The taxable proportion of Mardianah\u2019s $100,000 capital gain is $47,518. This is worked out as follows: $100,000 \u00d7 (2,600 + 750) \u00f7 (2,600 + 750 + 3,700) = $47,518 Because the combined period that Ahmed, Fayez and Mardianah owned the dwelling was more than 12\u00a0months, Mardianah can reduce her $47,518 capital gain by the 50% discount (after deducting any capital losses). Because Mardianah gets an exemption for the period the dwelling was Ahmed\u2019s main residence, her capital gain is less than it otherwise would have been. End of example For more information, see Deceased estates . Death during construction If an individual entered into a contract to construct, repair or renovate a home on land they already owned, and they die before certain conditions are met, the trustee may choose to have the home and land treated as the deceased\u2019s main residence for up to 4 years before the home became (or was to become) their main residence. The trustee can make this choice if the deceased dies before: the home is finished it was practicable for the home to be their main residence, or they had lived in the home for 3 months. If the trustee makes this choice, no other dwelling can be treated as the deceased\u2019s main residence during that time. If the trustee of a deceased estate disposes of residential property in Australia that was owned by a foreign resident, the trustee may no longer be entitled to claim the main residence exemption for the deceased\u2019s ownership period.

Media: When can I claim a deduction for rental expenses? https://tv.ato.gov.au/ato-tv/media?v=bd1bdiun85ited External Link ( Duration: 3:07) Rental expense categories There are three rental expense categories, those for which you: can claim a deduction now (in the income year you incur the expense) \u2013 for example, interest on loans, council rates, repairs and maintenance and depreciating assets costing $300 or less can claim a deduction over several years \u2013 for example, capital works, borrowing expenses and the decline in value of depreciating assets can't claim a deduction \u2013 for example, personal expenses, including expenses arising from your personal use of the property, some expenses of a capital nature and the purchase of second-hand (or used) depreciating assets after 9\u00a0May 2017. There may be some expenses you can claim a deduction for prior to the property being genuinely available for rent \u2013 such as interest on loans. You must incur these expenses with the intent to rent out the property. For example, renovating a property you intend to rent. If your intention changes you can't claim your expenses. It is important to claim each expense under the correct expense type to make sure you treat it correctly for tax purposes. Claim the right amount of expenses You will need to work out the amount of the expense that relates to your income-producing activities, if any of the following apply: your property is only genuinely available for rent for part of the year you use your property for personal purposes for part of the year you only use part of your property to earn rent you rent your property at non-commercial rates (less than market rates) you partially use your investment loan for personal purposes. You may need to decide which of your expenses are private in nature. For example, if you only rent out part of your property you should work out your expenses on a floor-area basis, based on the area solely occupied by the tenant. You can add to that a reasonable amount based on the tenant's access to common areas. For other examples, see the Rental properties guide . You don't need to apportion expenses that relate solely to renting out the property, such as advertising for tenants and real estate commissions. These are fully deductible in the year they are incurred. Positive or negative gearing Your rental property is 'positively geared' if your deductible expenses are less than the income you earn from the property \u2013 that is, you make a profit from renting out your property. Your rental property is said to be 'negatively geared' if your deductible expenses are more than the income you earn from the property. The overall tax result of a negatively geared property is a net rental loss. In this case, you may be able to claim a deduction for the full amount of rental expenses against your rental and other income \u2013 such as salary, wages or business income. If your other income is not enough to absorb the loss, you can carry forward your loss to the next income year. Changes to expenses you can claim Find out about changes to expenses you can claim below.

Menu Search Rental income you must declare Check which rental income you must declare and where you should declare it in your tax return. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download What you must declare You must declare all the income you receive for your rental property (including from overseas properties) in your tax return. These include: short-term rentals (for example, a holiday home) renting your property through a sharing platform (as examples, AirBNB, HomeAway or Flipkey) renting part or all of your home (for example, renting out a room) formal and domestic arrangements where you rent out to family and friends at less than commercial (or market) rates. Types of rental income Rental income can be payments you receive in cash or in the form of goods and services. You need to work out the monetary value of any payments you receive in the form of goods and services. Rental income is payment for rent from your tenant. These are paid to either you, your agent or a property manager. Payments relating to your rental income may include: bond money you retain in place of rent or keep because of damage to the property letting and booking fees you retain when renters or holiday makers cancel a booking insurance payouts, such as damage from a natural disaster (such as a bushfire, flood or cyclone) damage from an unexpected event (such as a burst sewage pipe) for the loss of rent money you receive from a relief fund in a disaster payments for deductible expenses , such as payments from a tenant to cover the cost of repairing property damage government rebates for buying a depreciating asset (for example, a solar hot water system) lump sum payments of rental income any assessable amounts relating to limited recourse debt arrangements involving your rental property. For more information, see IT\u00a02167 Income tax: rental properties \u2013 non-economic rental, holiday home, share of residence, etc. cases, family trust cases . Rental income and completing your tax return You must declare rent and payments relating to your rental property in your tax return: in the year your tenant pays rent (if your tenant pays your agent or property manager, you must declare rental income in the year your tenant pays them and not when the rental income is transferred to you) based on your legal ownership of the property (for example, if you own 50% of a property you must declare 50% of the rental income in your tax return). Example: Rental income and completing you tax return Stephanie and Patrick own a unit as joint tenants in equal shares, they have rented the property for the full year, via a property manager. The property manager takes care of routine maintenance, and deducts the expenses and property management fees from the rental income the tenant pays. The balance is then paid into Stephanie and Patrick's bank account. The tenant gives notice that they will be moving out and directs the property manager to use their bond to pay the final month's rent. The bond is released to the property manager on 30\u00a0June 2022, but the income is not paid into Stephanie and Patrick's account until 4\u00a0July 2022. When Stephanie and Patrick are preparing their tax return, they need to ensure they do all of the following: report the gross rent they earn, before it has been reduced by property management fees or any expenses paid by the property manager on their behalf include the final month's rent in the 2021\u201322 financial year, as it was received by their property manager in that financial year report their income and expenses 50/50 based on their legal ownership. End of example Where to report Include amounts that you earn: in Australia at 'You had Australian interest, or other Australian income or losses from investments or property' from overseas property at 'Other foreign income'.

Menu Search Share buy-backs How your tax is affected if you sell your shares back to the company. Last updated 27 November 2023 Print or Download Effect on capital gains tax If you dispose of shares you hold on capital account back to the company, it is a capital gains tax (CGT) event. This means you must: calculate your capital gain or loss by subtracting the cost of the shares from your capital proceeds report your capital gain or loss in your income tax return. If it is an off-market buy-back arrangement, your capital proceeds may be based on the market value of the shares, rather than the amount you receive. Time of capital gain or loss The point at which you make a capital gain or loss depends on the conditions of the buy-back offer. For example, it may be the time the company accepts your application to participate in the buy-back or, if it is a conditional offer of buy-back, the time you accept the offer. You report your capital gain or loss in your tax return for the year in which the CGT event happens. Capital proceeds from an off-market share buy-back An off-market share buy-back is when a company offers to buy its shares back from you directly, rather than buying them through a stock exchange in the open market. Usually the company writes to you with the offer. For CGT purposes, your capital proceeds cannot be less than what the market value of your shares would have been if the buy-back had not been proposed. Listed public company Any off-market share buy-back announced by listed public companies after 7:30\u00a0pm AEDT on 25\u00a0October 2022 will not contain a dividend component in the price. The entire buy-back price will be treated as capital proceeds. Company that is not a listed public company If the buy-back price is equal to or more than this market value, your capital proceeds are the amount paid, excluding any dividend paid as part of the buy-back. If the buy-back price is less than this market value, your capital proceeds are: what the market value of your shares would have been if the buy-back had not been proposed less any dividend paid under the buy-back. In this situation, the company may tell you the market value or obtain a class ruling from us. There are some further adjustments in circumstances where the participating shareholder is itself a company. Where a share buy-back affects a large shareholder group, we may publish guidance on events affecting shareholders . Example: off-market buy-back Ranjini bought 10,000\u00a0shares in a company that was not a listed public company at a cost of $6\u00a0per share, including brokerage. A few years later, the company wrote to its shareholders offering to buy back 10%\u00a0of their shares for $9.60 each. The buy-back price included a franked dividend of $1.40 per share, with each dividend to carry a franking credit of $0.60. Ranjini applied to participate in the buy-back to sell 1,000 of her shares. The company approved the buy-back on the same terms as its earlier letter of offer.

Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download Tax treatment If you hold shares as an investor: your shares are assets and are subject to capital gains tax when you sell them your costs are taken into account at the time you sell your shares if you have a capital loss you can use it to offset capital gains but not to offset income from other sources income is earned from dividends and similar receipts. If you are a share trader: your shares are treated like trading stock in a business your gains are treated as ordinary income your losses and costs are treated as deductible expenses in the year they are incurred. If you change from an investor to a trader, or vice versa, the treatment of your profits or losses will also change. Tax treatment of share investors and share traders Cost or receipt Share investor Share trader Profit from the sale of shares Subject to capital gains tax Assessable as ordinary income Loss from the sale of shares Used to offset capital gains or carried forward to offset future capital gains Cannot be used to offset income from other sources Deductible against income Dividends and similar receipts Included in assessable income Included in assessable income Purchase price of shares Taken into account in calculating capital gain or loss when shares are sold Deductible in the year incurred Transaction costs of buying or selling shares Taken into account in calculating capital gain or loss when shares are sold Deductible in the year incurred Costs (such as interest on borrowed money) incurred in earning dividend income from shares Deductible in the year incurred Deductible in the year incurred How to determine if you are a share trader Determining if you are a share trader is the same as determining whether your activities are considered to be carrying on a business for tax purposes. Under tax law, a business includes 'any profession, trade, employment, vocation or calling, but does not include occupation as an employee'. To determine whether you are a share trader or a business of trading shares, the following factors have been taken into account in court cases: the nature and purpose of your activities the repetition, volume and regularity of your activities whether your activities are organised in a business-like way the amount of capital invested. Nature of activity and purpose of profit making The intention to make a profit is not, on its own, sufficient to establish that a business is being carried on. A share trader carries on business activities for the purpose of earning income from buying and selling shares. Shares may be held for either investment or trading purposes, and profits on sale are earned in either case. A person who invests in shares as a shareholder (rather than a share trader) does so with the intention of earning income from dividends and receipts, but is not carrying on business activities. You need to consider not only your intention to make a profit, but also the facts of your situation. This includes how your activities have actually been carried out, or a business plan of how your activities will be carried out. A business plan might show, for example: analysis of the current market and each potential investment research to show when or where a profit may arise the basis of your decision-making on when to hold or sell shares. Repetition, volume and regularity Repetition is the frequency of transactions or the number of similar transactions. It is a key characteristic of business activities. The higher the volume of your share transactions, the more likely it is that you are carrying on a business. A business of share trading would also be expected to involve the purchase of shares on a regular basis through a regular or routine method. Organisation in a business-like way and keeping records A share-trading business could reasonably be expected to involve: study of daily and longer-term trends analysis of companies' prospectuses and annual reports seeking advice from experts. Your qualifications, expertise, training and skills in this area would also be relevant. Failure to keep records of share transactions would make it difficult for you to establish that a business of share trading was being carried on. Amount of capital invested The amount of capital you invest in shares is not a crucial factor in determining whether you are carrying on a business of share trading.

Amount of capital invested The amount of capital you invest in shares is not a crucial factor in determining whether you are carrying on a business of share trading. It is possible to carry on business activities with a relatively small amount of capital. On the other hand, you could invest a substantial amount of capital and not be considered a share trader. Example: shareholding as an investor George is an accountant. He has: bought 200,000\u00a0shares in 20\u00a0'blue chip companies over several years a total portfolio of $1.5\u00a0million. George bought the shares because of consistently high dividends, although he does invest in a small amount of growth stocks. He has purchased his shares for the purpose of earning dividend income rather than making a profit from buying and selling shares. George: monitors his share portfolio daily and analyses daily developments in equity markets using financial newspapers and stock market reports subscribes to news from online investment analysts. In the last income year, he sells 20,000 of his shares over a number of occasions for a gain of $50,000. Although George has made a large gain on the sale of shares, and has invested a significant amount of capital, he is not carrying on a business of share trading. End of example Changing from investor to trader, or trader to investor If you re-classify your activities, the way you treat your shareholdings will be affected. We may ask you to provide evidence that: the nature of your activities has changed you have reported your income correctly in the past. If we review your tax returns and find that you have incorrectly claimed losses, you may be subject to penalties. Changing from investor to trader If your activities change from investor to trader, your shares change from CGT assets to trading stock. When this happens, you can choose to start holding the shares as trading stock at either: their original cost their market value at the time of the change. If you choose market value CGT event K4 occurs \u2013 CGT asset starts being trading stock. This means you make a capital gain or loss on the shares, which you must report in your tax return. You work out your capital gain or loss based on the market value of your shares at the time of the change. Any unused capital losses from prior years (when you were an investor) remain as capital losses. You can't convert them into revenue losses. You should continue to carry forward any unused capital losses until you have a capital gain to offset them against. Changing from trader to investor If your activities change from trader to investor, your shares are no longer trading stock. At the time of the change, you treat your shares as if: just before they stopped being trading stock, you sold them to someone else (at arm's length and in the ordinary course of business) for their cost you immediately bought the shares back for the same amount. Work out if you are investing or trading in shares, and the difference it makes to your tax.

Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download To access or download a copy of this fact sheet in portable document format (PDF), see Top\u00a010 tips to help rental property owners avoid common tax mistakes (PDF, 215KB) This link will download a file Whether you use a tax agent or choose to lodge your tax return yourself, avoiding these common mistakes will save you time and money. 1. Getting initial repairs and capital improvements right You can't claim an immediate deduction for: Initial repairs on damage existing when you bought the property. For example, replacing a broken window pane and repairing damaged floorboards. You may be able to claim a deduction over several years as a capital works deduction. These costs are also used to work out your capital gain or capital loss when you sell the property. Improvements you make to the property. For example, you replace an entire structure like a roof when only part of it is damaged or renovating a bathroom. These are building costs that you can claim at 2.5% each year for 40\u00a0years from the date of completion. Damaged items that are detached from the house and cost more than $300. For example, replacing the entire hot water system \u2013 the cost must be claimed as a decline in value deduction over several years. 2. Claiming interest on your loan You can claim interest incurred on the amount borrowed as a deduction if you take out a loan for your rental property. You can only claim the part of the interest that relates to the rental property. If you use some of the loan for personal use, such as buying a boat or going on a holiday, you can\u2019t claim the interest on that part of the loan. If you do this, your interest must be apportioned for the duration of the loan or any refinanced loans, regardless of whether you repay the cost of your boat, holiday or other personal expense. It's important to take this into consideration when using your investment loan for private purposes. 3. Claiming borrowing expenses If your borrowing expenses are over $100, the deduction is spread over 5\u00a0years. If they are $100 or less, you can claim the full amount in the same income year you incurred the expense. Borrowing expenses: include loan establishment fees, title search fees and costs of preparing and filing mortgage documents. don't include stamp duty charged by your state or territory government on the property title. Remember to apportion your borrowing expenses in the first year based on the number of days you own the property. 4. Claiming purchase costs You can\u2019t claim deductions for the costs of buying your property. These include conveyancing fees and stamp duty (for properties outside the ACT). If you sell your property, these costs are used when working out if you need to pay capital gains tax. 5. Getting construction costs right You can claim certain building costs, including extensions, alterations and structural improvements as capital works deductions. Generally, you can claim a capital works deduction at 2.5% of the construction cost for 40\u00a0years from the date construction was completed. Where your property was previously owned by someone else and they claimed capital works deductions, ask them to provide you with the details so you can correctly calculate the deduction you\u2019re entitled to claim. If you can\u2019t get the details from the previous owner, you can use the services of a qualified professional who can estimate previous construction costs often based on a visit to your property. 6. Claiming body corporate fees and charges Payments you make to your body corporate administration fund are deductible in full in the year you incur them. If your body corporate raises funds applied to a special purposes fund to pay for major capital improvements or repairs of a capital nature, you can't claim an immediate deduction for these amounts. You may be able to claim a capital works deduction for your share of the expense once the work is complete. The cost must also be charged to either the special purpose fund or the general purpose sinking fund, if a special contribution has been levied.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4741, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4ec3aaa-1b19-4f54-aa93-cef21ee9046d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4ec3aaa-1b19-4f54-aa93-cef21ee9046d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/top-10-tips-to-help-rental-property-owners.md", "file_name": "top-10-tips-to-help-rental-property-owners.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 9457, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b0e48b3e-948e-4e12-ab5d-9ec5acac32b5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/top-10-tips-to-help-rental-property-owners.md", "file_name": "top-10-tips-to-help-rental-property-owners.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 9457, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "9711f29b1fb917efe6208f91cc9f5d0aadfbf5b129f9221cdb61e57a400ffaf6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "485d0f4c-1288-4f12-983b-802e0a61a0b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/top-10-tips-to-help-rental-property-owners.md", "file_name": "top-10-tips-to-help-rental-property-owners.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 9457, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "d254457dd096faf497a8b7317c8f2a0d918bad6b6947172558ec83a9da089b44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef676141-2f95-4f06-9a40-1d5a7e444c97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ebdd076a9ee1cba3725569ab7d43b67a26e11ba74f5310fe7575aabe3a51caef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6d8385f7c456f823fd1fb8d51793394c4223031b89e08fa08d0f7af0dbdd91b0", "text": "Where your property was previously owned by someone else and they claimed capital works deductions, ask them to provide you with the details so you can correctly calculate the deduction you\u2019re entitled to claim.

You may be able to claim a capital works deduction for your share of the expense once the work is complete. The cost must also be charged to either the special purpose fund or the general purpose sinking fund, if a special contribution has been levied. 7. Apportioning expenses and income for co-owned properties If you own a rental property with someone else, you must declare rental income and claim expenses according to your legal ownership of the property. As joint tenants your legal interest will be an equal split, and as tenants in common you may have different ownership interests. 8. Apportioning deductions for private use of your property You must limit the deductions you claim to the periods you can directly connect to earning assessable income. If you use only part of your property to earn rent or you rent it out for part of the year, you must apportion your expenses to reflect the area and days it was rented. Your private use of the property includes any use by you and if you: rent to family or friends below market rates keep it vacant. To claim a tax deduction for periods the property has been kept vacant, you must be able to show a clear intention to rent your property. This includes: advertising the property so that someone is likely to rent it by setting the rent in line with similar properties in the area avoiding unreasonable rental conditions. 9. Keeping the right records You must have evidence of your rental property income and expenses to claim a deduction. Capital gains tax may apply when you sell your rental property, so keep all records for the period you own the property and for 5\u00a0years from the date you sell it. 10. Getting your capital gains right when selling When you sell your rental property, you may make a capital gain or a capital loss. Generally, this is the difference between: what it cost you to buy, own and improve the property (cost base) what you receive when you sell it. Don't include amounts in your cost base which you have already claimed as a deduction against rental income earned from the property, including decline in value and capital works. You must also reduce your cost base by the amount of deductions claimed for capital works expenditure incurred after 7:30\u00a0pm on 13\u00a0May 1997. If you make a capital gain, include the gain in your tax return for that income year. If you make a capital loss, you can carry the loss forward and deduct it from capital gains in later years.

Menu Search Treating former home as main residence How the CGT main residence exemption works if you move out and use the 6-year rule when renting out your former home. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download How it works Your main residence (your home) is generally exempt from CGT. Usually, a property stops being your main residence when you stop living in it. However, for CGT purposes you can continue treating a property as your main residence: for up to 6\u00a0years if you used it to produce income, such as rent (sometimes called the '6-year rule') indefinitely if you didn't use it to produce income. During the time that you treat the property as your main residence after you stop living in it: It continues to be exempt from CGT (the same as if you were still living in it, even if you start renting it out after you leave). You can't treat any other property as your main residence (except for up to 6\u00a0months if you are moving house ). Eligibility The property must have: been your main residence first \u2013 you can't apply the main residence exemption to a period before a property first becomes your main residence (for example, if you rented out your home before you lived in it, the main residence exemption doesn't apply to the period you rented out your home) stopped being your actual main residence \u2013 that is, you stopped living in it. If the property was continuously your main residence , the usual rules for the main residence exemption apply. This means if you use it to produce income, such as rent, you will be entitled to only a partial main residence exemption from CGT. If you are a foreign resident when a CGT event happens to your residential property in Australia (for example, you sell it), you aren't entitled to claim the main residence exemption. See Main residence exemption for foreign residents . When and how to make the choice You choose to treat a property as your main residence in the income year a CGT event happens to the property when preparing your tax return \u2013 for example, the year you sell it based on the contract sale date, not the settlement date. You may own both the property: you choose to treat as your main residence when you no longer live in it you actually lived in. In this case, you make the choice in the income year you first sell one of those properties. To see how to complete myTax when you've sold a rental property, watch our video How to complete myTax when you've sold a rental property External Link . Former home not used for income If you don't use your former home to produce income (for example, you leave it vacant or use it as a holiday house) you can treat it as your main residence for an unlimited period after you stop living in it. This only applies if you aren't treating another property at the same time as your main residence. Example: former home not used to produce income Bill bought a unit and lived in it for 3\u00a0years. He then moved out to live with a friend while his son occupied the unit rent free. Bill didn't treat any other property as his main residence. Twelve years later, he sold the unit and claimed the main residence exemption from CGT. End of example Former home used for income If you use your former home to produce income (for example, you rent it out or make it available for rent), you can choose to treat it as your main residence for up to 6\u00a0years after you stop living in it. This is sometimes called the '6-year rule'. You can choose when to stop the period covered by your choice.

Twelve years later, he sold the unit and claimed the main residence exemption from CGT. End of example Former home used for income If you use your former home to produce income (for example, you rent it out or make it available for rent), you can choose to treat it as your main residence for up to 6\u00a0years after you stop living in it. This is sometimes called the '6-year rule'. You can choose when to stop the period covered by your choice. For example, if you rented it out for 5\u00a0years, you can choose to treat the property as your main residence for 3\u00a0years. If you're absent more than once when owning the property, the 6-year period applies to each period of absence.

When he completed his 2022\u201323 tax return, James decided to treat the Brisbane house as his main residence for the period after he moved out in October 2014 until he purchased his new main residence in Perth in October 2019. This is a period of less than 6\u00a0years. This means James is entitled to claim a partial main residence exemption under the '6-year rule'. As James decided not to treat the Brisbane house as his main residence after he bought the Perth house, he is subject to CGT for that period. This means James must include a capital gain or loss in the period not covered by the main residence exemption in his 2023 tax return (from October 2019 until March 2023). End of example Example: dwelling used to produce income for up to 6\u00a0years Lisa: bought and moved into a house in 2002 stopped living in the house in 2012 sold the house in 2022. While she lived in the house, she didn't use it to produce income. During the 10-year period after she moved out, Lisa: rented the house out for 3\u00a0years left it vacant for 2\u00a0years rented it out again for 3\u00a0years left it vacant again for 2\u00a0years. The total period Lisa used the house to produce income was 6\u00a0years, which meets the 6-year limit for treating it as her main residence. It doesn't matter if the 6\u00a0years is broken. While the house is vacant, the period is unlimited because the house is not being used to produce income. Lisa can choose to treat the house as her main residence for the entire 10-year period after she stopped living in it and disregard her capital gain or loss on the sale of the house. Lisa must include the CGT event in her tax return in the year of the contract sale date, even if she chooses to treat the house as her main residence for the period she stopped living in it. Lisa can claim the 'Main residence exemption' in her tax return. End of example Example: dwelling used to produce income during multiple absences Jez bought and moved into a house in 2003: In 2012, he had to move for work, so he stopped living in the house and rented it out for the next 5\u00a0years. In 2017 he moved back into the house and treated it as his main residence for 2\u00a0years. In 2019 he again moved and rented the house out, this time for 3\u00a0years. In 2022 he sold the house. While Jez lived in the house, he did not use it to produce income. The 6-year limit applies separately to each period of absence immediately following a period Jez lived in the property. This means Jez can choose to treat the house as his main residence for both rental periods and disregard his capital gain or loss on the sale of the house. Jez must include the CGT event in his tax return in the year of the contract sale date and claim the 'Main residence exemption' in his tax return.", "start_char_idx": 3447, "end_char_idx": 7509, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cfc42e8-3547-429f-9c82-dd79ddfcd04a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cfc42e8-3547-429f-9c82-dd79ddfcd04a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/treating-former-home-as-main-residence.md", "file_name": "treating-former-home-as-main-residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 13223, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58425f1a-3625-495e-9663-49d0014757d9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/treating-former-home-as-main-residence.md", "file_name": "treating-former-home-as-main-residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 13223, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "5cd07d60cc96b1c3e3fbe53eb3ea3948bb6ebab8577726e4cd622ffe9dd357d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "687a36cd-b014-4aa8-a0f3-0a08bdcb319a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/treating-former-home-as-main-residence.md", "file_name": "treating-former-home-as-main-residence.md", "file_type": "text/markdown", "file_size": 13223, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "e53f6086333329d7d67a0d641f63e4258fac53729526521408898f17966910fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "31e9d067-e943-4d60-b79f-0643000e4460", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9939968a81781906396b01d663dc9ddd47d341ac363e51b928914561d5254cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8438fb934ee5a7b557362fca0bb6c172bc07d10fb826adb23699ede592311cfa", "text": "In 2017 he moved back into the house and treated it as his main residence for 2\u00a0years.

End of example What happens if the 6-year limit is exceeded If you use your former home to produce income for more than 6\u00a0years in one absence, it is subject to CGT for the period after the 6-year limit. To work out your CGT when you dispose of your home: you need to work out your cost base, which is the market value of your home at the time you first used it to produce income, plus any allowable costs since then (this is the home first used to produce income rule) your capital gain or loss is based on the portion of time after first using your home to produce income; that is, over the 6-year limit. Example: former home used to produce income for more than 6\u00a0years Roya bought an apartment for $180,000. She immediately started living in the apartment as her main residence: On 29 September 1996, Roya moved interstate and rented out the apartment and at that time the market value of the apartment was $220,000. During her time interstate she didn't acquire another property. In July 2021, she returned to her home state and continued to rent out the apartment. She sold the apartment for $555,000 under a contract that settled on 29\u00a0September 2021. She incurred $15,000 in agent\u2019s and solicitor\u2019s fees when she sold. She had no other capital gains or losses. As Roya rented out the apartment, she can treat it as her main residence during her absence for a maximum of 6\u00a0years. This is the period 29\u00a0September 1996 to 29\u00a0September 2002. Roya must treat the apartment as though she acquired it: on the date she first used it produce income (29\u00a0September 1996) at the market value at that time ($220,000). Roya works out her CGT as follows: Capital proceeds \u2212 cost base = capital gain $555,000 \u2212 ($220,000 + $15,000) = $320,000 Non-main residence days (days over 6-year limit) 30\u00a0September 2002 to 29\u00a0September\u00a02021= 6,940\u00a0days Ownership period days (from deemed acquisition date) 29\u00a0September 1996 to 29\u00a0September\u00a02021= 9,132\u00a0days Assessable capital gain $320,000 \u00d7 (6,940 days \u00f7 9,132 days) = $243,188 She is eligible to use the 50% CGT discount to reduce her capital gain: $243,188\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050% = $121,594 Roya is not entitled to a full main residence exemption. She must also report a net capital gain of $121,594 on her 2022 tax return for the period the main residence exemption wasn't applied. End of example Former home used for income before you move out If you use any part of your home to produce income before you stop living in it, you can't apply the continuing main residence exemption to that part. This means you can't get the main residence exemption for that part of your home either before or after you stop living in it. Example: home used for income before ceasing to live in it Helen bought a house in 2006 and moved in immediately: She used 75% of the house as her main residence and the remaining 25% as a doctor's surgery. In 2017, she moved out and rented out the house. She sold the house in 2023, making a capital gain of $400,000.

Menu Search Using your home for rental or business Find out how your main residence exemption will be affected if you earn income from your home. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download How it works If you rent out part of your home or run a business from home, you do not get the full main residence exemption from capital gains tax (CGT). When you sell your home, the part you used for rental or to run a business is subject to CGT. You can usually claim income tax deductions for that part of your home because it has been used to produce assessable income. To work out your assessable capital gain or loss, you take into account: the proportion of the floor area that was set aside for rental or to run a business the period you used it for this purpose the capital gain or loss on your home since you first started using it for rental or business, assuming this was after 20\u00a0August 1996. If it was before this, you use the gain or loss since you acquired your home. It is a good idea to get your home valued when you first start using it for rental or business. You'll need to know this value later when you sell it. If you move out of your home and rent it out, you can continue treating your former home as your main residence for up to 6\u00a0years. However, you can\u2019t claim a main residence exemption for any other property for the same period Check whether CGT applies \u2013 the interest deductibility test You may not be entitled to a full main residence exemption if you use part of your home for producing assessable income. If you pass the interest deductibility test you will have some assessable capital gain. The test is, if you had borrowed to acquire the home would you be allowed a tax deduction for part of the home loan interest. If you would be eligible to claim part of the interest expense your home is subject to CGT to the same extent. If you actually have a home loan you cannot reduce the capital gain by not claiming some or all of the interest, nor can you increase the cost base of your home by the amount of interest you choose not to claim. You can still get a full main residence exemption if someone else uses part of your home to produce income and you receive no income from that person for the use of the property. Renting out part of your home If you rented out half your home for a period you would be entitled to claim a deduction for half of any home loan interest for that period. Therefore, half of the capital gain or loss for the period would be assessable. Running a business from home You are running a business from home if it is your principal place of business and you have a space set aside just for this purpose. Merely working from home occasionally does not qualify. You would be entitled to deduct part of any home loan interest if: part of your home is set aside exclusively as a place of business and is clearly identifiable as such that part of the home is not readily adaptable for private use \u2013 for example, a doctor's surgery located in a doctor's home. You would not be entitled to deduct interest expenses if, for example: you use a home study to do work usually done at your place of work you do paid child-minding at home (unless a special part of the home was set aside exclusively for that purpose). If you are not entitled to deduct interest expenses you are eligible for the full main residence exemption. Work out the assessable part of your capital gain or loss You can use the CGT property exemption tool to calculate the proportion of your home that is subject to CGT. Alternatively, you can work out the assessable part of your capital gain or loss as follows: Step 1: Work out the capital gain or loss on your home based on its value when you first used it to produce income. There are exceptions if you first used your home to produce income before 21\u00a0August 1996 or inherited your home. See Value of home when first used to produce income Step 2: Determine the proportion of your home's floor area that you set aside to produce income.

Step 4: Determine the number of days you used your home to produce income. Step 5: Determine the number of days from when you first used your home to produce income until you sold it. Step 6: Your assessable capital gain is step\u00a03 \u00d7 (step\u00a04 \u00f7 step\u00a05). Example: part of home used for income throughout ownership period Thomas bought a house on 1\u00a0July 2000 for $300,000. He sold it on 30\u00a0June 2023 for $700,000. The house was his main residence for the entire time. Throughout the period Thomas owned the house a tenant rented one bedroom, which represented 20% of the house. Both Thomas and the tenant used the living room, bathroom, laundry and kitchen, which represented 30% of the house. Only Thomas used the remainder of the house. Therefore, Thomas would be entitled to a 35% deduction (20%\u00a0+\u00a0(30%\u00a0\u00f7\u00a02 people) for home loan interest (if he incurred it). Using the steps above , Thomas works out his assessable capital gain as follows. Thomas used his home to produce income from the time he acquired it. Therefore he uses its initial value to work out his capital gain: $700,000 \u2212 $300,000 = $400,000. The proportion of the floor area set aside for rental is 35%. Thomas' assessable capital gain is $400,000 \u00d7 35% = $140,000. As he used his home for income right up to when he sold it, he does not need to apportion the time it was used to produce income. As Thomas owned his house for at least 12\u00a0months he can use the CGT discount (50% for individuals) to reduce his capital gain. Therefore, Thomas's assessable capital gain would be $70,000. End of example Example: part of home used for income for part of ownership period Fatima bought a house in December 1995 for $200,000. It was her main residence. On 1\u00a0November 2015 she started to use 40% of the house for a consultancy business. At that time the market value of the house was $520,000. On 1\u00a0August 2019 she shifted her consultancy practice to separate business premises and once again used her home solely for private purposes. On 1\u00a0May 2023 she sold her house for $620,000. Using the steps above , Fatima works out her assessable capital gain as follows. Her capital gain based on the value of her home when she first used it to produce income is $620,000 \u2212 $520,000 = $100,000. The proportion of her home's floor area set aside for business was 40%. $100,000 \u00d7 40% = $40,000. As Fatima stopped using her home for business before she sold it, she continues to step 4. Fatima used her home to produce income from 1\u00a0November 2015 to 1\u00a0August 2019, a total of 1,370 days. The period from when she first used her home to produce income until she sold it is 2,739 days. Fatima's assessable capital gain is $40,000 \u00d7 1,370 \u00f7 2,739 = $20,007.

This is more than 12\u00a0months before she sold it, so she can use the CGT discount (50% for individuals) to reduce her capital gain. Therefore, Fatima's assessable capital gain would be $10,003. End of example Value of home when first used to produce income If you use your home to produce income you are generally taken to have acquired it at the time you first used it for this purpose. This means when you sell your home, you work out the capital gain or loss using its market value at the time you first used it to produce income. It is called the 'home first used to produce income rule'. If you sell your home within 12\u00a0months of when you first use it to produce income you cannot use the CGT discount. Exclusions If you: use your home to produce income from the time you acquire it, the rule does not affect you \u2013 for example, see Rental property becomes your main residence inherit a dwelling that was the deceased\u2019s main residence \u2013 the rule does not apply if you sell the dwelling within 2\u00a0years choose to continue treating a property as your main residence after you move out \u2013 if the property is fully exempt, the rule does not apply. Example \u2013 'Home first used to produce income rule' does not apply Peter bought a house on 1\u00a0October 2010 for $550,000. He rented it out until 30\u00a0June 2013. Peter moved into the house on 1\u00a0July 2013 and lived in it for the entire period until it was sold on 30\u00a0March 2023 for $780,000. The \u2018home first used to produce income rule\u2019 does not apply as the house was rented from the time Peter acquired it. This means that Peter is not required to use the market value of the house at the time it was first used to produce income. Peter will work out the capital gain based on the cost base of $550,000. Peter is entitled to the main residence exemption from 1\u00a0July 2013 to 30\u00a0March 2023 (3,560\u00a0days). The assessable part of Peter\u2019s capital gain will be calculated as follows: Capital gain for the entire period is $780,000 \u2212 $550,000 = $230,000 Peter\u2019s home was rented out for 1,004\u00a0days (1\u00a0October 2010 to 30\u00a0June 2013) Peter\u2019s total period of ownership was 4,564\u00a0days. Capital gain for the period that was rented out is $230,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(1,004\u00a0\u00f7\u00a04,564)\u00a0=\u00a0$50,577. Peter is entitled to the CGT discount of 50% which will reduce his capital gain. This means Peter\u2019s assessable capital gain would be $25,288. End of example When the rule applies Apart from the exclusions above, the rule applies if all of the following are true: you acquired the property on or after 20\u00a0September 1985 you first used the property to produce income after 20\u00a0August 1996 when you sell the property (or another CGT event happens to it), you would get only a partial CGT exemption because you used it to produce income during the period you owned it you would have been entitled to a full exemption if the sale or other CGT event happened to the property immediately before you first used it to produce income. Example: home becomes a rental property Erin bought a house in July\u00a02011 for $450,000. The house was her main residence until she moved into a new house on 1\u00a0August\u00a02022.

End of example Watch: Selling a rental property that was your home Media: Selling a rental property that was your home https://tv.ato.gov.au/ato-tv/media?v=bd1bdiubfs6pgq External Link ( Duration: 3:17) Rental property becomes your main residence If your rental property becomes your main residence, your eligibility for a main residence exemption is limited to the period you lived in the property. For the period the property was rented out, you will be liable for CGT when you sell the property. Use the following formula to work out your CGT when you sell your property: Capital gain or loss \u00d7\u00a0(number of days the property was used to produce income\u00a0\u00f7\u00a0total number of days you owned the property) The total number of days you owned the property is calculated using the contract purchase and sale dates, not settlement dates. You can also use the Capital gains tax property exemption tool to work out what percentage of your capital gain is exempt from capital gains tax (CGT). Example: Rental property becomes your home Farnaz entered into a contract to purchase a property on 21\u00a0October 2016 for $449,000. She immediately rented out the property. The property was rented for 2\u00a0years, until Farnaz moved into the property on 16\u00a0November 2018. Farnaz lived in the property as her main residence until she signed a contract to sell her home on 1\u00a0April 2023 for $987,500. Farnaz works out her net capital gain as follows: Capital gain is $538,500 (worked out as $987,500 \u2212 $449,000) Number of days owned is 2,354 Number of days the property was used to produce income is 756 Assessable capital gain is $538,500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(756\u00a0\u00f7\u00a02,354)\u00a0=\u00a0$172,942. Net capital gain after applying the 50% CGT discount for owning the property for over 12\u00a0months is $86,471 (worked out as $172,942\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050%) Farnaz includes a net capital gain of $86,471 in her 2023 tax return. End of example Small business CGT concessions If you are not entitled to a full main residence exemption because you use your home for business purposes, you may be able to apply the small business CGT concessions to reduce your capital gain.

How capital gains tax (CGT) works, and how you report and pay tax on capital gains when you sell assets. Last updated 29 June 2023 Print or Download Capital gains tax (CGT) is the tax you pay on profits from disposing of assets including investments, such as property, shares and crypto assets. Although it is referred to as 'capital gains tax', it's part of your income tax. It's not a separate tax. If you dispose of assets (generally when you stop being the owner of an asset) a CGT event may be triggered. This is when you need to report capital gains and capital losses in your income tax return. If you have a: capital gain, it will increase the tax you need to pay \u2013 you may want to work out how much tax you will owe and set aside funds to cover it capital loss, you can offset it against any capital gains in the year they occur, or in future years, and reduce the tax you need to pay \u2013 it's important to include losses on your tax return. Example: calculating CGT Maree buys some shares for $5,000. She owns the shares for 6\u00a0months and sells them for $5,500. She has no other capital gains or losses. Maree declares a capital gain of $500 in her tax return. She will pay tax on this gain at her individual income tax rate. End of example How capital gains tax (CGT) works, and how you report and pay tax on capital gains when you sell assets.

The guide explains that the Australian tax system is a mix of direct and indirect taxes imposed by both the Commonwealth and State governments. The Commonwealth has jurisdiction to tax Australian residents on worldwide income and non-residents on Australian sourced income. Australia has entered into double tax agreements with other countries to avoid double taxation. The guide also discusses taxes on income, capital gains, and consumption taxes such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

Capital gains tax (CGT) is part of your income tax and applies to profits from disposing of assets such as property, shares, and crypto assets. Selling shares or units is the most common CGT event, but there are other events that can trigger CGT. CGT does not apply to dividends received from investments or profits on the sale of shares if you are carrying on a business of share trading.
